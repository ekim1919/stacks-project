\section{Introduction}
\label{section-introduction}

\noindent
The title of this chapter is a bit misleading because the most
basic material on restricted power series is in the chapter on
formal algebraic spaces. For example
Formal Spaces, Section \ref{formal-spaces-section-restricted-power-series}
defines the restricted power series ring $A\{x_1, \ldots, x_n\}$
given a linearly topologized ring $A$. In
Formal Spaces, Section \ref{formal-spaces-section-tft}
we discuss the relationship between these restricted power
series rings and morphisms of finite type between
locally countably indexed formal algebraic spaces.

\medskip\noindent
Let $A$ be a Noetherian ring and let $I \subset A$ be an ideal. In the
first part of this chapter
(Sections \ref{section-two-categories} -- \ref{section-over-G-ring})
we discuss the category of $I$-adically complete algebras $B$
topologically of finite type over a Noetherian ring $A$.
It is shown that $B = A\{x_1, \ldots, x_n\}/J$ for some
(closed) ideal $J$ in the restricted power series ring
(where $A$ is endowed with the $I$-adic topology).
We show there is a good notion of a naive cotangent complex
$\NL_{B/A}^\wedge$. If some power of $I$ annihilates
$\NL_{B/A}^\wedge$, then we think of $\text{Spf}(B)$ as
a rig-\'etale formal algebraic space over $A$. This leads to
a definition of rig-\'etale morphisms of Noetherian
formal algebraic spaces. After a certain amount of work
we are able to prove the main result of the first part:
if $\text{Spf}(B)$ is rig-\'etale over $A$ as above,
then there exists a finite type $A$-algebra $C$
such that $B$ is isomorphic to the $I$-adic completion of $C$, see
Lemma \ref{lemma-approximate-by-etale-over-complement}.
One thing to note here is that we prove this without assuming
the ring $A$ is excellent or even a G-ring. In the last section
of the first part we show that under the assumption that
$A$ is a G-ring there is a straightforward
proof of the lemma based on Popescu's theorem.

\medskip\noindent
Many of the results discussed in the first part can be found in the paper
\cite{Elkik}. Other general references for this part are
\cite{EGA}, \cite{Abbes}, and \cite{Fujiwara-Kato}.

\medskip\noindent
In the second part of this chapter we use the main result of
the first part to prove Artin's result on dilatations from \cite{ArtinII}.
The result on contractions will be the subject of a later chapter
(insert future reference here).
The main existence theorem is the equivalence of categories in
Theorem \ref{theorem-dilatations-general}.
It is more general than Artin's result in that it shows that any
rig-\'etale morphism $f : W \to \Spec(A)_{/V(I)}$
is the completion of a morphism $Y \to \Spec(A)$
of algebraic spaces $X$ which is locally of finite type
and isomorphism away from $V(I)$. In Artin's work
the morphism $f$ is assumed proper and rig-surjective.
A special case of this is the main lemma mentioned
above and the general case follows from this by
a straightforward (somewhat lengthy) glueing procedure.
There are several lemmas modifying the main theorem
the final one of which is (almost) exactly the statement in
Artin's paper.
In the last section we apply the results to modifications
of $\Spec(A)$ before and after completion.









\section{Two categories}
\label{section-two-categories}

\noindent
Let $A$ be a ring and let $I \subset A$ be an ideal.
In this section ${}^\wedge$ will mean $I$-adic completion.
Set $A_n = A/I^n$ so that the $I$-adic completion of $A$ is
$A^\wedge = \lim A_n$. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be the
category
\begin{equation}
\label{equation-C}
\mathcal{C} =
\left\{
\begin{matrix}
\text{inverse systems }\ldots \to B_3 \to B_2 \to B_1 \\
\text{where }B_n\text{ is a finite type }A_n\text{-algebra,}\\
B_{n + 1} \to B_n\text{ is an }A_{n + 1}\text{-algebra map}\\
\text{which induces }B_{n + 1}/I^nB_{n + 1} \cong B_n
\end{matrix}
\right\}
\end{equation}
Morphisms in $\mathcal{C}$ are given by systems of homomorphisms.
Let $\mathcal{C}'$ be the category
\begin{equation}
\label{equation-C-prime}
\mathcal{C}' =
\left\{
\begin{matrix}
A\text{-algebras }B\text{ which are }I\text{-adically complete}\\
\text{such that }B/IB\text{ is of finite type over }A/I
\end{matrix}
\right\}
\end{equation}
Morphisms in $\mathcal{C}'$ are $A$-algebra maps. There is a functor
\begin{equation}
\label{equation-from-complete-to-systems}
\mathcal{C}' \longrightarrow \mathcal{C},\quad
B \longmapsto (B/I^nB)
\end{equation}
Indeed, since $B/IB$ is of finite type over $A/I$ the ring maps
$A_n = A/I^n \to B/I^nB$ are of finite type by
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-finite-type-mod-nilpotent}.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-topologically-finite-type}
Let $A$ be a ring and let $I \subset A$ be a finitely generated ideal.
The functor
$$
\mathcal{C} \longrightarrow \mathcal{C}',\quad
(B_n) \longmapsto B = \lim B_n
$$
is a quasi-inverse to (\ref{equation-from-complete-to-systems}).
The completions $A[x_1, \ldots, x_r]^\wedge$ are in $\mathcal{C}'$ and
any object of $\mathcal{C}'$ is of the form
$$
B = A[x_1, \ldots, x_r]^\wedge / J
$$
for some ideal $J \subset A[x_1, \ldots, x_r]^\wedge$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $(B_n)$ be an object of $\mathcal{C}$. By
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-limit-complete}
we see that $B = \lim B_n$ is $I$-adically complete
and $B/I^nB = B_n$. Hence we see that $B$ is an object of
$\mathcal{C}'$ and that we can recover the object $(B_n)$ 
by taking the quotients.
Conversely, if $B$ is an object of $\mathcal{C}'$, then
$B = \lim B/I^nB$ by assumption. Thus $B \mapsto (B/I^nB)$ is a quasi-inverse
to the functor of the lemma.

\medskip\noindent
Since $A[x_1, \ldots, x_r]^\wedge = \lim A_n[x_1, \ldots, x_r]$
it is an object of $\mathcal{C}'$ by the first statement of the lemma.
Finally, let $B$ be an object of $\mathcal{C}'$. Choose
$b_1, \ldots, b_r \in B$ whose images in $B/IB$ generate
$B/IB$ as an algebra over $A/I$. Since $B$ is $I$-adically
complete, the $A$-algebra map $A[x_1, \ldots, x_r] \to B$, $x_i \mapsto b_i$
extends to an $A$-algebra map $A[x_1, \ldots, x_r]^\wedge \to B$.
To finish the proof we have to show this map is surjective
which follows from Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-completion-generalities}
as our map $A[x_1, \ldots, x_r] \to B$ is surjective modulo $I$
and as $B = B^\wedge$.
\end{proof}

\noindent
We warn the reader that, in case $A$ is not Noetherian, the
quotient of an object of $\mathcal{C}'$ may not be an object
of $\mathcal{C}'$. See Examples, Lemma
\ref{examples-lemma-noncomplete-quotient}.
Next we show this does not happen when $A$ is Noetherian.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-topologically-finite-type-Noetherian}
\begin{reference}
\cite[Proposition 7.5.5]{EGA1}
\end{reference}
Let $A$ be a Noetherian ring and let $I \subset A$ be an ideal. Then
\begin{enumerate}
\item every object of the category $\mathcal{C}'$
(\ref{equation-C-prime}) is Noetherian,
\item if $B \in \Ob(\mathcal{C}')$ and $J \subset B$ is an ideal,
then $B/J$ is an object of $\mathcal{C}'$,
\item for a finite type $A$-algebra $C$ the $I$-adic completion
$C^\wedge$ is in $\mathcal{C}'$,
\item in particular the completion $A[x_1, \ldots, x_r]^\wedge$
is in $\mathcal{C}'$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Part (4) follows from
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-completion-Noetherian-Noetherian}
as $A[x_1, \ldots, x_r]$ is Noetherian
(Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-Noetherian-permanence}).
To see (1) by Lemma \ref{lemma-topologically-finite-type}
we reduce to the case of the completion of the polynomial ring
which we just proved.
Part (2) follows from Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-completion-tensor}
which tells us that ever finite $B$-module is $IB$-adically complete.
Part (3) follows in the same manner as part (4).
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}[Base change]
\label{remark-base-change}
Let $\varphi : A_1 \to A_2$ be a ring map and let
$I_i \subset A_i$ be ideals such that $\varphi(I_1^c) \subset I_2$
for some $c \geq 1$. This induces ring maps
$A_{1, cn} = A_1/I_1^{cn} \to A_2/I_2^n = A_{2, n}$ for all $n \geq 1$.
Let $\mathcal{C}_i$ be the category (\ref{equation-C}) for $(A_i, I_i)$.
There is a base change functor
\begin{equation}
\label{equation-base-change-systems}
\mathcal{C}_1 \longrightarrow \mathcal{C}_2,\quad
(B_n) \longmapsto (B_{cn} \otimes_{A_{1, cn}} A_{2, n})
\end{equation}
Let $\mathcal{C}_i'$ be the category (\ref{equation-C-prime}) for $(A_i, I_i)$.
If $I_2$ is finitely generated, then there is a base change functor
\begin{equation}
\label{equation-base-change-complete}
\mathcal{C}_1' \longrightarrow \mathcal{C}_2',\quad
B \longmapsto (B \otimes_{A_1} A_2)^\wedge
\end{equation}
because in this case the completion is complete
(Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-hathat-finitely-generated}).
If both $I_1$ and $I_2$ are finitely generated, then
the two base change functors agree via the functors
(\ref{equation-from-complete-to-systems})
which are equivalences by Lemma \ref{lemma-topologically-finite-type}.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}[Base change by closed immersion]
\label{remark-take-bar}
Let $A$ be a Noetherian ring and $I \subset A$ an ideal.
Let $\mathfrak a \subset A$ be an ideal. Denote $\bar A = A/\mathfrak a$.
Let $\bar I \subset \bar A$ be an ideal such that
$I^c \bar A \subset \bar I$ and $\bar I^d \subset I\bar A$
for some $c, d \geq 1$. In this case the base change functor
(\ref{equation-base-change-complete}) for $(A, I)$ to $(\bar A, \bar I)$
is given by $B \mapsto \bar B = B/\mathfrak aB$. Namely, we have
\begin{equation}
\label{equation-base-change-to-closed}
\bar B = (B \otimes_A \bar A)^\wedge = (B/\mathfrak a B)^\wedge =
B/\mathfrak a B
\end{equation}
the last equality because any finite $B$-module is $I$-adically complete by
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-completion-tensor}
and if annihilated by $\mathfrak a$ also $\bar I$-adically complete by
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-change-ideal-completion}.
\end{remark}







\section{A naive cotangent complex}
\label{section-naive-cotangent-complex}

\noindent
Let $A$ be a Noetherian ring and let $I \subset A$ be a ideal.
Let $B$ be an $A$-algebra which is $I$-adically complete such
that $A/I \to B/IB$ is of finite type, i.e., an object of
(\ref{equation-C-prime}).
By Lemma \ref{lemma-topologically-finite-type-Noetherian} we can write
$$
B = A[x_1, \ldots, x_r]^\wedge / J
$$
for some finitely generated ideal $J$. For a choice of presentation as
above we define the {\it naive cotangent complex}
in this setting by the formula
\begin{equation}
\label{equation-NL}
\NL_{B/A}^\wedge = (J/J^2 \longrightarrow \bigoplus B\text{d}x_i)
\end{equation}
with terms sitting in degrees $-1$ and $0$
where the map sends the residue class of $g \in J$ to the differential
$\text{d}g = \sum (\partial g/\partial x_i) \text{d}x_i$. Here
the partial derivative is taken by thinking of $g$ as a power series.
The following lemma shows that $\NL_{B/A}^\wedge$ is well defined
up to homotopy.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-NL-up-to-homotopy}
Let $A$ be a Noetherian ring and let $I \subset A$ be a ideal.
Let $B$ be an object of (\ref{equation-C-prime}). The naive
cotangent complex $\NL_{B/A}^\wedge$ is well defined in $K(B)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The lemma signifies that given a second presentation
$B = A[y_1, \ldots, y_s]^\wedge / K$ the complexes of $B$-modules
$$
(J/J^2 \to B\text{d}x_i)
\quad\text{and}\quad
(K/K^2 \to \bigoplus B\text{d}y_j)
$$
are homotopy equivalent. To see this, we can argue exactly as in
the proof of Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-NL-homotopy}.

\medskip\noindent
Step 1. If we choose $g_i(y_1, \ldots, y_s) \in A[y_1, \ldots, y_s]^\wedge$
mapping to the image of $x_i$ in $B$, then we obtain a (unique) continuous
$A$-algebra homomorphism
$$
A[x_1, \ldots, x_r]^\wedge \to A[y_1, \ldots, y_s]^\wedge,\quad
x_i \mapsto g_i(y_1, \ldots, y_s)
$$
compatible with the given surjections to $B$. Such a map is called
a morphism of presentations. It induces a map from $J$ into $K$
and hence induces a $B$-module map $J/J^2 \to K/K^2$. Sending
$\text{d}x_i$ to $\sum (\partial g_i/\partial y_j)\text{d}y_j$
we obtain a map of complexes
$$
(J/J^2 \to \bigoplus B\text{d}x_i)
\longrightarrow
(K/K^2 \to \bigoplus B\text{d}y_j)
$$
Of course we can do the same thing with the roles of the two presentations
exchanged to get a map of complexes in the other direction.

\medskip\noindent
Step 2. The construction above is compatible with compositions of morphsms
of presentations. Hence to finish the proof it suffices to show: given
$g_i(x_1, \ldots, x_r) \in A[x_1, \ldots, x_n]^\wedge$
mapping to the image of $x_i$ in $B$, the induced map of complexes
$$
(J/J^2 \to \bigoplus B\text{d}x_i)
\longrightarrow
(J/J^2 \to \bigoplus B\text{d}x_i)
$$
is homotopic to the identity map. To see this consider the map
$h : \bigoplus B \text{d}x_i \to J/J^2$ given by the rule
$\text{d}x_i \mapsto g_i(x_1, \ldots, x_n) - x_i$ and compute.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-NL-is-completion}
Let $A$ be a Noetherian ring and let $I \subset A$ be a ideal.
Let $A \to B$ be a finite type ring map. Choose a presentation
$\alpha : A[x_1, \ldots, x_n] \to B$. Then
$\NL_{B^\wedge/A}^\wedge = \lim \NL(\alpha) \otimes_B B^\wedge$
as complexes and
$\NL_{B^\wedge/A}^\wedge = \NL_{B/A} \otimes_B^\mathbf{L} B^\wedge$
in $D(B^\wedge)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The statement makes sense as $B^\wedge$ is an object of
(\ref{equation-C-prime}) by
Lemma \ref{lemma-topologically-finite-type-Noetherian}.
Let $J = \Ker(\alpha)$. The functor of taking
$I$-adic completion is exact on finite modules over
$A[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$ and agrees with the functor
$M \mapsto M \otimes_{A[x_1, \ldots, x_n]} A[x_1, \ldots, x_n]^\wedge$, see
Algebra, Lemmas \ref{algebra-lemma-completion-tensor} and
\ref{algebra-lemma-completion-flat}. Moreover, the ring maps
$A[x_1, \ldots, x_n] \to A[x_1, \ldots, x_n]^\wedge$
and $B \to B^\wedge$ are flat. Hence
$B^\wedge = A[x_1, \ldots, x_n]^\wedge / J^\wedge$ and
$$
(J/J^2) \otimes_B B^\wedge = (J/J^2)^\wedge = J^\wedge/(J^\wedge)^2
$$
Since $\NL(\alpha) = (J/J^2 \to \bigoplus B\text{d}x_i)$,
see Algebra, Section \ref{algebra-section-netherlander},
we conclude the complex $\NL_{B^\wedge/A}^\wedge$ is equal
to $\NL(\alpha) \otimes_B B^\wedge$. The final statement
follows as $\NL_{B/A}$ is homotopy equivalent to $\NL(\alpha)$
and because the ring map $B \to B^\wedge$ is flat (so derived
base change along $B \to B^\wedge$ is just base change).
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-NL-is-limit}
Let $A$ be a Noetherian ring and let $I \subset A$ be a ideal.
Let $B$ be an object of (\ref{equation-C-prime}). Then
\begin{enumerate}
\item the pro-objects
$\{\NL_{B/A}^\wedge \otimes_B B/I^nB\}$ and $\{\NL_{B_n/A_n}\}$
of $D(B)$ are strictly isomorphic (see proof for elucidation),
\item $\NL_{B/A}^\wedge = R\lim \NL_{B_n/A_n}$ in $D(B)$.
\end{enumerate}
Here $B_n$ and $A_n$ are as in Section \ref{section-two-categories}.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The statement means the following: for every $n$ we have a well
defined complex $\NL_{B_n/A_n}$ of $B_n$-modules and we have
transition maps $\NL_{B_{n + 1}/A_{n + 1}} \to \NL_{B_n/A_n}$.
See Algebra, Section \ref{algebra-section-netherlander}.
Thus we can consider
$$
\ldots \to \NL_{B_3/A_3} \to \NL_{B_2/A_2} \to \NL_{B_1/A_1}
$$
as an inverse system of complexes of $B$-modules and a fortiori as
an inverse system in $D(B)$. Furthermore $R\lim \NL_{B_n/A_n}$
is a homotopy limit of this inverse system, see
Derived Categories, Section \ref{derived-section-derived-limit}.

\medskip\noindent
Choose a presentation $B = A[x_1, \ldots, x_r]^\wedge / J$. This
defines presentations
$$
B_n = B/I^nB = A_n[x_1, \ldots, x_r]/J_n
$$
where
$$
J_n = JA_n[x_1, \ldots, x_r] =
J/(J \cap I^nA[x_1, \ldots, x_r]^\wedge)
$$
The two term complex $J_n/J_n^2 \longrightarrow \bigoplus B_n \text{d}x_i$
represents $\NL_{B_n/A_n}$, see
Algebra, Section \ref{algebra-section-netherlander}.
By Artin-Rees (Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-Artin-Rees})
in the Noetherian ring $A[x_1, \ldots, x_r]^\wedge$
(Lemma \ref{lemma-topologically-finite-type-Noetherian})
we find a $c \geq 0$ such that we have canonical surjections
$$
J/I^nJ \to J_n \to J/I^{n - c}J \to J_{n - c},\quad n \geq c
$$
for all $n \geq c$. A moment's thought shows that these maps are
compatible with differentials and we obtain maps of complexes
$$
\NL_{B/A}^\wedge \otimes_B B/I^nB \to
\NL_{B_n/A_n} \to
\NL_{B/A}^\wedge \otimes_B B/I^{n - c}B \to
\NL_{B_{n - c}/A_{n - c}}
$$
compatible with the transition maps of the inverse systems
$\{\NL_{B/A}^\wedge \otimes_B B/I^nB\}$ and $\{\NL_{B_n/A_n}\}$.
This proves part (1) of the lemma.

\medskip\noindent
By part (1) and since pro-isomorphic
systems have the same $R\lim$ in order to prove (2)
it suffices to show that $\NL_{B/A}^\wedge$ is
equal to $R\lim \NL_{B/A}^\wedge \otimes_B B/I^nB$.
However, $\NL_{B/A}^\wedge$ is a two term complex $M^\bullet$
of finite $B$-modules which are $I$-adically complete for example by
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-completion-tensor}. Hence
$M^\bullet = \lim M^\bullet/I^nM^\bullet = R\lim M^\bullet/I^n M^\bullet$, see
More on Algebra, Lemma \ref{more-algebra-lemma-compute-Rlim-modules} and
Remark \ref{more-algebra-remark-how-unique}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-NL-base-change}
Let $(A_1, I_1) \to (A_2, I_2)$ be as in
Remark \ref{remark-base-change} with $A_1$ and $A_2$ Noetherian.
Let $B_1$ be in (\ref{equation-C-prime}) for $(A_1, I_1)$.
Let $B_2$ be the base change of $B_1$. Then there is a canonical map
$$
\NL_{B_1/A_1} \otimes_{B_2} B_1 \to \NL_{B_2/A_2}
$$
which induces and isomorphism on $H^0$ and a surjection on $H^{-1}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Choose a presentation $B_1 = A_1[x_1, \ldots, x_r]^\wedge/J_1$.
Since
$A_2/I_2^n[x_1, \ldots, x_r] =
A_1/I_1^{cn}[x_1, \ldots, x_r] \otimes_{A_1/I_1^{cn}} A_2/I_2^n$
we have
$$
A_2[x_1, \ldots, x_r]^\wedge =
(A_1[x_1, \ldots, x_r]^\wedge \otimes_{A_1} A_2)^\wedge
$$
where we use $I_2$-adic completion on both sides (but of course
$I_1$-adic completion for $A_1[x_1, \ldots, x_r]^\wedge$).
Set $J_2 = J_1 A_2[x_1, \ldots, x_r]^\wedge$. Arguing similarly
we get the presentation
\begin{align*}
B_2
& =
(B_1 \otimes_{A_1} A_2)^\wedge \\
& =
\lim \frac{A_1/I_1^{cn}[x_1, \ldots, x_r]}{J_1(A_1/I_1^{cn}[x_1, \ldots, x_r])}
\otimes_{A_1/I_1^{cn}} A_2/I_2^n \\
& =
\lim \frac{A_2/I_2^n[x_1, \ldots, x_r]}{J_2(A_2/I_2^n[x_1, \ldots, x_r])} \\
& =
A_2[x_1, \ldots, x_r]^\wedge/J_2
\end{align*}
for $B_2$ over $A_2$. As a consequence obtain a commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
\NL^\wedge_{B_1/A_1} : \ar[d] &
J_1/J_1^2 \ar[r]_-{\text{d}} \ar[d] & \bigoplus B_1\text{d}x_i \ar[d] \\
\NL^\wedge_{B_2/A_2} : &
J_2/J_2^2 \ar[r]^-{\text{d}} & \bigoplus B_2\text{d}x_i
}
$$
The induced arrow $J_1/J_1^2 \otimes_{B_1} B_2 \to J_2/J_2^2$
is surjective because $J_2$ is generated by the image of $J_1$.
This determines the arrow displayed in the lemma. We omit the proof
that this arrow is well defined up to homotopy (i.e., indepedent
of the choice of the presentations up to homotopy). The statement
about the induced map on cohomology modules follows easily
from the discussion (details omitted).
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-exact-sequence-NL}
Let $A$ be a Noetherian ring and let $I \subset A$ be a ideal.
Let $B \to C$ be morphism of (\ref{equation-C-prime}). Then
there is an exact sequence
$$
\xymatrix{
C \otimes_B H^0(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge) \ar[r] &
H^0(\NL_{C/A}^\wedge) \ar[r] &
H^0(\NL_{C/B}^\wedge) \ar[r] & 0 \\
H^{-1}(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge \otimes_B C) \ar[r] &
H^{-1}(\NL_{C/A}^\wedge) \ar[r] &
H^{-1}(\NL_{C/B}^\wedge) \ar[llu]
}
$$
See proof for elucidation.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Observe that taking the tensor product $\NL_{B/A}^\wedge \otimes_B C$
makes sense as $\NL_{B/A}^\wedge$ is well defined up to homotopy by
Lemma \ref{lemma-NL-up-to-homotopy}.
Also, $(B, IB)$ is pair where $B$ is a Noetherian ring
(Lemma \ref{lemma-topologically-finite-type-Noetherian})
and $C$ is in the corresponding category (\ref{equation-C-prime}).
Thus all the terms in the $6$-term sequence are (well) defined.

\medskip\noindent
Choose a presentation $B = A[x_1, \ldots, x_r]^\wedge/J$.
Choose a presentation $C = B[y_1, \ldots, y_s]^\wedge/J'$.
Combinging these presentations gives a presentation
$$
C = A[x_1, \ldots, x_r, y_1, \ldots, y_s]^\wedge/K
$$
Then the reader verifies that we obtain a commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
0 \ar[r] &
\bigoplus C \text{d}x_i \ar[r] &
\bigoplus C \text{d}x_i \oplus \bigoplus C \text{d}y_j \ar[r] &
\bigoplus C \text{d}y_j \ar[r] &
0 \\
&
J/J^2 \otimes_B C \ar[r] \ar[u] &
K/K^2 \ar[r] \ar[u] &
J'/(J')^2 \ar[r] \ar[u] &
0
}
$$
with exact rows. Note that the vertical arrow on the left hand side
is the tensor product of the arrow defining $\NL_{B/A}^\wedge$ with
$\text{id}_C$. The lemma follows by applying the snake lemma
(Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-snake}).
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-transitive-lci-at-end}
With assumptions as in Lemma \ref{lemma-exact-sequence-NL}
assume that $B/I^nB \to C/I^nC$ is a local complete intersection
homomorphism for all $n$. Then
$H^{-1}(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge \otimes_B C) \to H^{-1}(\NL_{C/A}^\wedge)$
is injective.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
For each $n \geq 1$ we set $A_n = A/I^n$, $B_n = B/I^nB$, and
$C_n = C/I^nC$. We have
\begin{align*}
H^{-1}(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge \otimes_B C)
& =
\lim H^{-1}(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge \otimes_B C_n) \\
& =
\lim H^{-1}(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge \otimes_B B_n \otimes_{B_n} C_n) \\
& =
\lim H^{-1}(\NL_{B_n/A_n} \otimes_{B_n} C_n)
\end{align*}
The first equality follows from
More on Algebra, Lemma \ref{more-algebra-lemma-consequence-Artin-Rees}
and the fact that $H^{-1}(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge \otimes_B C)$ is a finite
$C$-module and hence $I$-adically complete for example by
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-completion-tensor}.
The second equality is trivial.
The third holds by Lemma \ref{lemma-NL-is-limit}.
The maps $H^{-1}(\NL_{B_n/A_n} \otimes_{B_n} C_n) \to
H^{-1}(\NL_{C_n/A_n})$ are injective by
More on Algebra, Lemma \ref{more-algebra-lemma-transitive-lci-at-end}.
The proof is finished because we also have
$H^{-1}(\NL_{C/A}^\wedge) = \lim H^{-1}(\NL_{C_n/A_n})$
similarly to the above.
\end{proof}









\section{Rig-smooth algebras}
\label{section-rig-smooth}

\noindent
As motivation for the following definition, please take a look at
More on Algebra, Remark \ref{more-algebra-remark-smoothness-ext-1-zero}.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-rig-smooth-homomorphism}
Let $A$ be a Noetherian ring and let $I \subset A$ be an ideal.
Let $B$ be an object of (\ref{equation-C-prime}). We say
$B$ is {\it rig-smooth over $(A, I)$} if there exists an integer $c \geq 0$
such that $I^c$ annihilates $\Ext^1_B(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge, N)$ for every
$B$-module $N$.
\end{definition}

\noindent
Let us work out what this means.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-equivalent-with-artin-smooth}
Let $A$ be a Noetherian ring and let $I \subset A$ be an ideal.
Let $B$ be an object of (\ref{equation-C-prime}). Write
$B = A[x_1, \ldots, x_r]^\wedge/J$
(Lemma \ref{lemma-topologically-finite-type-Noetherian})
and let $\NL_{B/A}^\wedge = (J/J^2 \to \bigoplus B\text{d}x_i)$
be its naive cotangent complex (\ref{equation-NL}).
The following are equivalent
\begin{enumerate}
\item $B$ is rig-smooth over $(A, I)$,
\item the object $\NL_{B/A}^\wedge$ of $D(B)$ satisfies the equivalent
conditions (1) -- (4) of More on Algebra, Lemma
\ref{more-algebra-lemma-ext-1-annihilated} with respect to the ideal $IB$,
\item there exists a $c \geq 0$ such that for all $a \in I^c$
there is a map $h : \bigoplus B\text{d}x_i \to J/J^2$ such that
$a : J/J^2 \to J/J^2$ is equal to $h \circ \text{d}$,
\item there exist $b_1, \ldots, b_s \in B$ such that
$V(b_1, \ldots, b_s) \subset V(IB)$ and such that for every
$l = 1, \ldots, s$ there exist $m \geq 0$, $f_1, \ldots, f_m \in J$,
and subset $T \subset \{1, \ldots, n\}$ with $|T| = m$ such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\det_{i \in T, j \leq m}(\partial f_j/ \partial x_i)$
divides $b_l$ in $B$, and
\item $b_l J \subset (f_1, \ldots, f_m) + J^2$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The equivalence of (1), (2), and (3) is immediate from
More on Algebra, Lemma \ref{more-algebra-lemma-ext-1-annihilated}.

\medskip\noindent
Assume $b_1, \ldots, b_s$ are as in (4). Since $B$ is Noetherian the inclusion
$V(b_1, \ldots, b_s) \subset V(IB)$ implies $I^cB \subset (b_1, \ldots, b_s)$
for some $c \geq 0$ (for example by
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-Noetherian-power-ideal-kills-module}).
Pick $1 \leq l \leq s$ and $m \geq 0$ and $f_1, \ldots, f_m \in J$
and $T \subset \{1, \ldots, n\}$ with $|T| = m$ satisfying (4)(a) and (b).
Then if we invert $b_l$ we see that
$$
\NL_{B/A}^\wedge \otimes_B B_{b_l} =
\left(
\bigoplus\nolimits_{j \leq m} B_{b_l} f_j
\longrightarrow
\bigoplus\nolimits_{i = 1, \ldots, n} B_{b_l} \text{d}x_i
\right)
$$
and moreover the arrow is isomorphic to the inclusion of the direct
summand $\bigoplus_{i \in T} B_{b_l} \text{d}x_i$. We conclude that
$H^{-1}(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge)$ is $b_l$-power torsion and that
$H^0(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge)$ becomes finite free after inverting $b_l$.
Combined with the inclusion $I^cB \subset (b_1, \ldots, b_s)$
we see that $H^{-1}(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge)$ is $IB$-power torsion.
Hence we see that condition (4) of
More on Algebra, Lemma \ref{more-algebra-lemma-ext-1-annihilated}
holds. In this way we see that (4) implies (2).

\medskip\noindent
Assume the equivalent conditions (1), (2), and (3) hold. We will prove
that (4) holds, but we strongly urge the reader to convince themselves
of this. The complex $\NL_{B/A}^\wedge$ determines an object of
$D^b_{\textit{Coh}}(\Spec(B))$ whose restriction to the Zariski open
$U = \Spec(B) \setminus V(IB)$ is a finite locally free module
$\mathcal{E}$ placed in degree $0$ (this follows for example from the
the fourth equivalent condition in
More on Algebra, Lemma \ref{more-algebra-lemma-ext-1-annihilated}).
Choose generators $f_1, \ldots, f_M$ for $J$.
This determines an exact sequence
$$
\bigoplus\nolimits_{j = 1, \ldots, M} \mathcal{O}_U \cdot f_j \to
\bigoplus\nolimits_{i = 1, \ldots, n} \mathcal{O}_U \cdot \text{d}x_i \to
\mathcal{E} \to 0
$$
Let $U = \bigcup_{l = 1, \ldots, s} U_l$
be a finite affine open covering such that
$\mathcal{E}|_{U_l}$ is free of rank $r_l = n - m_l$ for some integer
$n \geq m_l \geq 0$. After replacing
each $U_l$ by an affine open covering we may assume there exists
a subset $T_l \subset \{1, \ldots, n\}$ such that the elements
$\text{d}x_i$, $i \in \{1, \ldots, n\} \setminus T_l$ map to a
basis for $\mathcal{E}|_{U_l}$. Repeating the argument, we may
assume there exists a subset $T'_l \subset \{1, \ldots, M\}$
of cardinality $m_l$ such that $f_j$, $j \in T'_l$ map to a basis
of the kernel of $\mathcal{O}_{U_l} \cdot \text{d}x_i \to
\mathcal{E}|_{U_l}$. Finally, since the open covering
$U = \bigcup U_l$ may be refined by a open covering by standard opens
(Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-Zariski-topology})
we may assume $U_l = D(g_l)$ for some $g_l \in B$.
In particular we have $V(g_1, \ldots, g_s) = V(IB)$.
A linear algebra argument using our choices above shows that
$\det_{i \in T_l, j \in T'_l}(\partial f_j/ \partial x_i)$
maps to an invertible element of $B_{b_l}$. Similarly, the vanishing
of cohomology of $\NL_{B/A}^\wedge$ in degree $-1$ over $U_l$ shows that
$J/J^2 + (f_j; j \in T')$ is annihilated by a power of $b_l$.
After replacing each $g_l$ by a suitable power we obtain
conditions (4)(a) and (4)(b) of the lemma. Some details omitted.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-rig-smooth}
Let $A$ be a Noetherian ring and let $I$ be an ideal.
Let $B$ be a finite type $A$-algebra.
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $\Spec(B) \to \Spec(A)$ is smooth over $\Spec(A) \setminus V(I)$,
then $B^\wedge$ is rig-smooth over $(A, I)$.
\item If $B^\wedge$ is rig-smooth over $(A, I)$,
then there exists $g \in 1 + IB$ such that $\Spec(B_g)$ is smooth
over $\Spec(A) \setminus V(I)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We will use Lemma \ref{lemma-equivalent-with-artin-smooth}
without further mention.

\medskip\noindent
Assume (1). Recall that formation of $\NL_{B/A}$ commutes with
localization, see Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-localize-NL}.
Hence by the very definition of smooth ring maps (in terms of
the naive cotangent complex being quasi-isomorphic to a finite
projective module placed in degree $0$), we see that
$\NL_{B/A}$ satisfies the fourth equivalent condition
of More on Algebra, Lemma \ref{more-algebra-lemma-ext-1-annihilated}
with respect to the ideal $IB$ (small detail omitted).
Since $\NL_{B^\wedge/A}^\wedge = \NL_{B/A} \otimes_B B^\wedge$
by Lemma \ref{lemma-NL-is-completion} we conclude (2) holds by
More on Algebra, Lemma
\ref{more-algebra-lemma-base-change-property-ext-1-annihilated}.

\medskip\noindent
Assume (2). Choose a presentation
$B = A[x_1, \ldots, x_n]/J$, set $N = J/J^2$, and
consider the element $\xi \in \Ext^1_B(\NL_{B/A}, J/J^2)$
determined by the identity map on $J/J^2$.
Using again that $\NL_{B^\wedge/A}^\wedge = \NL_{B/A} \otimes_B B^\wedge$
we find that our assumption implies the image
$$
\xi \otimes 1 \in
\Ext^1_{B^\wedge}(\NL_{B/A} \otimes_B B^\wedge, N \otimes_B B^\wedge) =
\Ext^1_{B^\wedge}(\NL_{B/A}, N) \otimes_B B^\wedge
$$
is annihilated by $I^c$ for some integer $c \geq 0$.
The equality holds for example by
More on Algebra, Lemma \ref{more-algebra-lemma-base-change-RHom}
(but can also easily be deduced from the much simpler
More on Algebra, Lemma
\ref{more-algebra-lemma-pseudo-coherence-and-base-change-ext}).
Thus $M = I^cB\xi \subset \Ext^1_B(\NL_{B/A}, N)$ is a finite submodule
which maps to zero in $\Ext^1_B(\NL_{B/A}, N) \otimes_B B^\wedge$.
Since $B \to B^\wedge$ is flat this means that
$M \otimes_B B^\wedge$ is zero. By 
Nakayama's lemma (Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-NAK})
this means that $M = I^cB\xi$ is annihilated by an element
of the form $g = 1 + x$ with $x \in IB$.
This implies that for every $b \in I^cB$ there is a
$B$-linear dotted arrow making the diagram commute
$$
\xymatrix{
J/J^2 \ar[r] \ar[d]^b & \bigoplus B\text{d}x_i \ar@{..>}[d]^h \\
J/J^2 \ar[r] & (J/J^2)_g
}
$$
Thus $(\NL_{B/A})_{gb}$ is quasi-isomorphic
to a finite projective module; small detail omitted.
Since $(\NL_{B/A})_{gb} = \NL_{B_{gb}/A}$ in $D(B_{gb})$
this shows that $B_{gb}$ is smooth over $\Spec(A)$.
As this holds for all $b \in I^cB$ we conclude
that $\Spec(B_g) \to \Spec(A)$ is smooth over $\Spec(A) \setminus V(I)$
as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-zero-ext-1-after-modding-out}
Let $(A_1, I_1) \to (A_2, I_2)$ be as in
Remark \ref{remark-base-change} with $A_1$ and $A_2$ Noetherian.
Let $B_1$ be in (\ref{equation-C-prime}) for $(A_1, I_1)$.
Let $B_2$ be the base change of $B_1$. Let $f_1 \in B_1$
with image $f_2 \in B_2$.
If $\Ext^1_{B_1}(\NL_{B_1/A_1}^\wedge, N_1)$ is annihilated
by $f_1$ for every $B_1$-module $N_1$, then
$\Ext^1_{B_2}(\NL_{B_2/A_2}^\wedge, N_2)$ is annihilated
by $f_2$ for every $B_2$-module $N_2$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By Lemma \ref{lemma-NL-base-change} there is a map
$$
\NL_{B_1/A_1} \otimes_{B_2} B_1 \to \NL_{B_2/A_2}
$$
which induces and isomorphism on $H^0$ and a surjection on $H^{-1}$.
Thus the result by More on Algebra, Lemmas
\ref{more-algebra-lemma-two-term-base-change},
\ref{more-algebra-lemma-base-change-property-ext-1-annihilated}, and
\ref{more-algebra-lemma-surjection-property-ext-1-annihilated}
the last two applied with the principal ideals $(f_1) \subset B_1$ and
$(f_2) \subset B_2$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-base-change-rig-smooth-homomorphism}
Let $A_1 \to A_2$ be a map of Noetherian rings. Let $I_i \subset A_i$
be an ideal such that $V(I_1A_2) = V(I_2)$. Let $B_1$ be in
(\ref{equation-C-prime}) for $(A_1, I_1)$.
Let $B_2$ be the base change of $B_1$ as in
Remark \ref{remark-base-change}.
If $B_1$ is rig-smooth over $(A_1, I_1)$,
then $B_2$ is rig-smooth over $(A_2, I_2)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Follows from Lemma \ref{lemma-zero-ext-1-after-modding-out} and
Definition \ref{definition-rig-smooth-homomorphism}
and the fact that $I_2^c$ is contained in $I_1A_2$ for some $c \geq 0$
as $A_2$ is Noetherian.
\end{proof}













\section{Deformations of ring homomorphisms}
\label{section-defos-ring-maps}

\noindent
Some work on lifting ring homomorphisms from rig-smooth algebras.

\begin{remark}[Linear approximation]
\label{remark-linear-approximation}
Let $A$ be a ring and $I \subset A$ be a finitely generated ideal.
Let $C$ be an $I$-adically complete $A$-algebra.
Let $\psi : A[x_1, \ldots, x_r]^\wedge \to C$ be a continuous
$A$-algebra map. Suppose given $\delta_i \in C$, $i = 1, \ldots, r$.
Then we can consider
$$
\psi' : A[x_1, \ldots, x_r]^\wedge \to C,\quad
x_i \longmapsto \psi(x_i) + \delta_i
$$
see Formal Spaces, Remark \ref{formal-spaces-remark-universal-property}.
Then we have
$$
\psi'(g) = \psi(g) + \sum \psi(\partial g/\partial x_i)\delta_i + \xi
$$
with error term $\xi \in (\delta_i\delta_j)$. This follows by
writing $g$ as a power series and working term by term. Convergence
is automatic as the coefficients of $g$ tend to zero.
Details omitted.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}[Lifting maps]
\label{remark-improve-homomorphism}
Let $A$ be a Noetherian ring and $I \subset A$ be an ideal.
Let $B$ be an object of (\ref{equation-C-prime}).
Let $C$ be an $I$-adically complete $A$-algebra.
Let $\psi_n : B \to C/I^nC$ be an $A$-algebra homomorphism.
The obstruction to lifting $\psi_n$ to an $A$-algebra
homomorphism into $C/I^{2n}C$ is an element
$$
o(\psi_n) \in \Ext^1_B(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge, I^nC/I^{2n}C)
$$
as we will explain. Namely, choose a presentation
$B = A[x_1, \ldots, x_r]^\wedge/J$.
Choose a lift $\psi : A[x_1, \ldots, x_r]^\wedge \to C$ of $\psi_n$.
Since $\psi(J) \subset I^nC$ we get $\psi(J^2) \subset I^{2n}C$
and hence we get a $B$-linear homomorphism
$$
o(\psi) :
J/J^2 \longrightarrow I^nC/I^{2n}C, \quad g \longmapsto \psi(g)
$$
which of course extends to a $C$-linear map
$J/J^2 \otimes_B C \to I^nC/I^{2n}C$.
Since $\NL_{B/A}^\wedge = (J/J^2 \to \bigoplus B \text{d}x_i)$
we get $o(\psi_n)$ as the image of $o(\psi)$ by the identification
\begin{align*}
& \Ext^1_B(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge, I^nC/I^{2n}C) \\
& =
\Coker\left(\Hom_B(\bigoplus B\text{d}x_i, I^nC/I^{2n}C) \to
\Hom_B(J/J^2, I^nC/I^{2n}C)\right)
\end{align*}
See More on Algebra, Lemma
\ref{more-algebra-lemma-map-out-of-almost-free} part (1) for the equality.

\medskip\noindent
Suppose that $o(\psi_n)$ maps to zero in
$\Ext^1_B(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge, I^{n'}C/I^{2n'}C)$
for some integer $n'$ with $n > n' > n/2$. We claim that this means we can
find an $A$-algebra homomorphism $\psi'_{2n'} : B \to C/I^{2n'}C$
which agrees with $\psi_n$ as maps into $C/I^{n'}C$.
The extreme case $n' = n$ explains why we previously said
$o(\psi_n)$ is the obstruction to lifting $\psi_n$ to $C/I^{2n}C$.
Proof of the claim: the hypothesis that $o(\psi_n)$ maps to zero tells us
we can find a $B$-module map
$$
h : \bigoplus B\text{d}x_i \longrightarrow I^{n'}C/I^{2n'}C
$$
such that $o(\psi)$ and $h \circ \text{d}$ agree as maps
into $I^{n'}C/I^{2n'}C$. Say $h(\text{d}x_i) = \delta_i \bmod I^{2n'}C$
for some $\delta_i \in I^{n'}C$. Then we look at the map
$$
\psi' : A[x_1, \ldots, x_r]^\wedge \to C,\quad
x_i \longmapsto \psi(x_i) - \delta_i
$$
A computation with power series
shows that $\psi'(J) \subset I^{2n'}C$. Namely, for $g \in J$ we get
$$
\psi'(g) \equiv
\psi(g) - \sum \psi(\partial g/\partial x_i)\delta_i \equiv
o(\psi)(g) - (h \circ \text{d})(g) \equiv
0 \bmod I^{2n'}C
$$
See Remark \ref{remark-linear-approximation} for the first equality.
Hence $\psi'$ induces an $A$-algebra homomorphism
$\psi'_{2n'} : B \to C/I^{2n'}C$ as desired.
\end{remark}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-get-morphism-general-better}
Assume given the following data
\begin{enumerate}
\item an integer $c \geq 0$,
\item an ideal $I$ of a Noetherian ring $A$,
\item $B$ in (\ref{equation-C-prime}) for $(A, I)$ such that
$I^c$ annihilates $\Ext^1_B(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge, N)$
for any $B$-module $N$,
\item a Noetherian $I$-adically complete $A$-algebra $C$; denote
$d = d(\text{Gr}_I(C))$ and $q_0 = q(\text{Gr}_I(C))$ the integers found in
Local Cohomology, Section \ref{local-cohomology-section-uniform},
\item an integer $n \geq \max(q_0 + (d + 1)c, 2(d + 1)c + 1)$, and
\item an $A$-algebra homomorphism $\psi_n : B \to C/I^nC$.
\end{enumerate}
Then there exists a map $\varphi : B \to C$ of $A$-algebras such
that $\psi_n \bmod I^{n - (d + 1)c} = \varphi \bmod I^{n - (d + 1)c}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Consider the obstruction class
$$
o(\psi_n) \in \Ext^1_B(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge, I^nC/I^{2n}C)
$$
of Remark \ref{remark-improve-homomorphism}. For any $C/I^nC$-module
$N$ we have
\begin{align*}
\Ext^1_B(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge, N)
& =
\Ext^1_{C/I^nC}(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge \otimes_B^\mathbf{L} C/I^nC, N) \\
& =
\Ext^1_{C/I^nC}(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge \otimes_B C/I^nC, N)
\end{align*}
The first equality by
More on Algebra, Lemma \ref{more-algebra-lemma-upgrade-adjoint-tensor-RHom}
and the second one by
More on Algebra, Lemma \ref{more-algebra-lemma-two-term-base-change}.
In particular, we see that
$\Ext^1_{C/I^nC}(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge \otimes_B C/I^nC, N)$ is annihilated by
$I^cC$ for all $C/I^nC$-modules $N$.
It follows that we may apply
Local Cohomology, Lemma \ref{local-cohomology-lemma-bound-two-term-complex}
to see that $o(\psi_n)$ maps to zero in
$$
\Ext^1_{C/I^nC}(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge \otimes_B C/I^nC, I^{n'}C/I^{2n'}C) =
\Ext^1_B(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge, I^{n'}C/I^{2n'}C) =
$$
where $n' = n - (d + 1)c$. By the discussion in
Remark \ref{remark-improve-homomorphism} we obtain a map
$$
\psi'_{2n'} : B \to C/I^{2n'}C
$$
which agrees with $\psi_n$ modulo $I^{n'}$.
Observe that $2n' > n$ because $n \geq 2(d + 1)c + 1$.

\medskip\noindent
We may repeat this procedure. Starting with $n_0 = n$ and
$\psi^0 = \psi_n$ we end up getting a strictly increasing
sequence of integers
$$
n_0 < n_1 < n_2 < \ldots
$$
and $A$-algebra homorphisms $\psi^i : B \to C/I^{n_i}C$
such that $\psi^{i + 1}$ and $\psi^i$ agree modulo $I^{n_i - tc}$.
Since $C$ is $I$-adically complete we can take $\varphi$
to be the limit of the maps
$\psi^i \bmod I^{n_i - (d + 1)c} : B \to C/I^{n_i - (d + 1)c}C$
and the lemma follows.
\end{proof}

\noindent
We suggest the reader skip ahead to the next section. Namely, the following
two lemmas are consequences of the result above if the algebra $C$ in them
is assumed Noetherian.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-get-morphism-nonzerodivisor}
Let $I = (a)$ be a principal ideal of a Noetherian ring $A$.
Let $B$ be an object of (\ref{equation-C-prime}).
Assume given an integer $c \geq 0$ such that $\Ext^1_B(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge, N)$
is annihilated by $a^c$ for all $B$-modules $N$.
Let $C$ be an $I$-adically complete $A$-algebra such that
$a$ is a nonzerodivisor on $C$. Let $n > 2c$. For any $A$-algebra
map $\psi_n : B \to C/a^nC$ there exists an $A$-algebra
map $\varphi : B \to C$ such that
$\psi_n \bmod a^{n - c}C = \varphi \bmod a^{n - c}C$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Consider the obstruction class
$$
o(\psi_n) \in \Ext^1_B(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge, a^nC/a^{2n}C)
$$
of Remark \ref{remark-improve-homomorphism}. Since $a$ is a nonzerodivisor
on $C$ the map $a^c : a^nC/a^{2n}C \to a^nC/a^{2n}C$ is isomorphic to the
map $a^nC/a^{2n}C \to a^{n - c}C/a^{2n - c}C$ in the category of $C$-modules.
Hence by our assumption on $\NL_{B/A}^\wedge$
we conclude that the class $o(\psi_n)$ maps to zero in
$$
\Ext^1_B(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge, a^{n - c}C/a^{2n - c}C)
$$
and a fortiori in
$$
\Ext^1_B(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge, a^{n - c}C/a^{2n - 2c}C)
$$
By the discussion in Remark \ref{remark-improve-homomorphism} we obtain a map
$$
\psi_{2n - 2c} : B \to C/a^{2n - 2c}C
$$
which agrees with $\psi_n$ modulo $a^{n - c}C$.
Observe that $2n - 2c > n$ because $n > 2c$.

\medskip\noindent
We may repeat this procedure. Starting with $n_0 = n$ and
$\psi^0 = \psi_n$ we end up getting a strictly increasing
sequence of integers
$$
n_0 < n_1 < n_2 < \ldots
$$
and $A$-algebra homorphisms $\psi^i : B \to C/a^{n_i}C$
such that $\psi^{i + 1}$ and $\psi^i$ agree modulo $a^{n_i - c}C$.
Since $C$ is $I$-adically complete we can take $\varphi$
to be the limit of the maps
$\psi^i \bmod a^{n_i - c}C : B \to C/a^{n_i - c}C$
and the lemma follows.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-get-morphism-principal}
Let $I = (a)$ be a principal ideal of a Noetherian ring $A$.
Let $B$ be an object of (\ref{equation-C-prime}).
Assume given an integer $c \geq 0$ such that $\Ext^1_B(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge, N)$
is annihilated by $a^c$ for all $B$-modules $N$.
Let $C$ be an $I$-adically complete $A$-algebra.
Assume given an integer $d \geq 0$ such that $C[a^\infty] \cap a^dC = 0$.
Let $n > \max(2c, c + d)$. For any $A$-algebra map
$\psi_n : B \to C/a^nC$ there exists an $A$-algebra map
$\varphi : B \to C$ such
that $\psi_n \bmod a^{n - c} = \varphi \bmod a^{n - c}$.
\end{lemma}

\noindent
If $C$ is Noetherian we have $C[a^\infty] = C[a^e]$ for some
$e \geq 0$. By Artin-Rees (Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-Artin-Rees})
there exists an integer $f$ such that
$a^nC \cap C[a^\infty] \subset a^{n - f}C[a^\infty]$ for all $n \geq f$.
Then $d = e + f$ is an integer as in the lemma. This argument
works in particular if $C$ is an object of (\ref{equation-C-prime})
by Lemma \ref{lemma-topologically-finite-type-Noetherian}.

\begin{proof}
Let $C \to C'$ be the quotient of $C$ by $C[a^\infty]$. The $A$-algebra
$C'$ is $I$-adically complete by
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-quotient-complete}
and the fact that $\bigcap (C[a^\infty] + a^nC) = C[a^\infty]$
because for $n \geq d$ the sum $C[a^\infty] + a^nC$ is direct.
For $m \geq d$ the diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
0 \ar[r] &
C[a^\infty] \ar[r] \ar[d] &
C \ar[r] \ar[d] & C' \ar[r] \ar[d] & 0 \\
0 \ar[r] &
C[a^\infty] \ar[r] &
C/a^m C \ar[r] & C'/a^m C' \ar[r] & 0
}
$$
has exact rows. Thus $C$ is the fibre product of $C'$ and
$C/a^mC$ over $C'/a^mC'$ for all $m \geq d$. By
Lemma \ref{lemma-get-morphism-nonzerodivisor}
we can choose a homomorphism $\varphi' : B \to C'$
such that $\varphi'$ and $\psi_n$ agree as maps into $C'/a^{n - c}C'$.
We obtain a homomorphism $(\varphi', \psi_n \bmod a^{n - c}C) : B \to
C' \times_{C'/a^{n - c}C'} C/a^{n - c}C$.
Since $n - c \geq d$ this is the same thing as a homomorphism
$\varphi : B \to C$. This finishes the proof.
\end{proof}










\section{Algebraization of rig-smooth algebras over G-rings}
\label{section-over-G-ring}

\noindent
If the base ring $A$ is a Noetherian G-ring, then we can
prove \cite[III Theorem 7]{Elkik} for arbitrary rig-smooth
algebras with respect to any ideal $I \subset A$ (not necessarily
principal).

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-close-enough}
Let $I$ be an ideal of a Noetherian ring $A$. Let $r \geq 0$
and write $P = A[x_1, \ldots, x_r]$ the $I$-adic completion.
Consider a resolution
$$
P^{\oplus t} \xrightarrow{K} P^{\oplus m}
\xrightarrow{g_1, \ldots, g_m} P \to B \to 0
$$
of a quotient of $P$. Assume $B$ is rig-smooth over $(A, I)$.
Then there exists an integer $n$ such that for any complex
$$
P^{\oplus t} \xrightarrow{K'} P^{\oplus m}
\xrightarrow{g'_1, \ldots, g'_m} P
$$
with $g_i - g'_i \in I^nP$ and $K - K' \in I^n\text{Mat}(m \times t, P)$
there exists an isomorphism $B \to B'$ of $A$-algebras where
$B' = P/(g'_1, \ldots, g'_m)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
(A) By Definition \ref{definition-rig-smooth-homomorphism}
we can choose a $c \geq 0$ such that $I^c$ annihilates
$\Ext^1_B(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge, N)$ for all $B$-modules $N$.

\medskip\noindent
(B) By More on Algebra, Lemmas \ref{more-algebra-lemma-approximate-complex} and
\ref{more-algebra-lemma-approximate-complex-graded}
there exists a constant $c_1 = c(g_1, \ldots, g_m, K)$
such that for $n \geq c_1 + 1$ the complex
$$
P^{\oplus t} \xrightarrow{K'} P^{\oplus m}
\xrightarrow{g'_1, \ldots, g'_m} P \to B' \to 0
$$
is exact and $\text{Gr}_I(B) \cong \text{Gr}_I(B')$.

\medskip\noindent
(C) Let $d_0 = d(\text{Gr}_I(B))$ and $q_0 = q(\text{Gr}_I(B))$
be the integers found in
Local Cohomology, Section \ref{local-cohomology-section-uniform}.

\medskip\noindent
We claim that $n = \max(c_1 + 1, q_0 + (d_0 + 1)c, 2(d_0 + 1)c + 1)$
works where $c$ is as in (A), $c_1$ is as in (B), and $q_0, d_0$ are as
in (C).

\medskip\noindent
Let $g'_1, \ldots, g'_m$ and $K'$ be as in the lemma.
Since $g_i = g'_i \in I^nP$ we obtain a canonical
$A$-algebra homomorphism
$$
\psi_n : B \longrightarrow B'/I^nB'
$$
which induces an isomorphism $B/I^nB \to B'/I^nB'$. Since
$\text{Gr}_I(B) \cong \text{Gr}_I(B')$ we have
$d_0 = d(\text{Gr}_I(B'))$ and $q_0 = q(\text{Gr}_I(B'))$
and since $n \geq \max(q_0 + (1 + d_0)c, 2(d_0 + 1)c + 1)$
we may apply Lemma \ref{lemma-get-morphism-general-better}
to find an $A$-algebra homomorphism
$$
\varphi : B \longrightarrow B'
$$
such that
$\varphi \bmod I^{n - (d_0 + 1)c}B' = \psi_n \bmod I^{n - (d_0 + 1)c}B'$.
Since $n - (d_0 + 1)c > 0$ we see that $\varphi$ is an $A$-algebra
homomorphism which modulo $I$ induces the isomorphism $B/IB \to B'/IB'$
we found above.
The rest of the proof shows that these facts force $\varphi$
to be an isomorphism; we suggest the reader find their own proof of this.

\medskip\noindent
Namely, it follows that $\varphi$ is surjective for example by applying
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-completion-generalities} part (1)
using the fact that $B$ and $B'$ are complete.
Thus $\varphi$ induces a surjection $\text{Gr}_I(B) \to \text{Gr}_I(B')$
which has to be an isomorphism because the source and target are
isomorphic Noetherian rings, see
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-surjective-endo-noetherian-ring-is-iso}
(of course you can show $\varphi$ induces the isomorphism we found above
but that would need a tiny argument).
Thus $\varphi$ induces injective maps
$I^eB/I^{e + 1}B \to I^eB'/I^{e + 1}B'$ for all $e \geq 0$.
This implies $\varphi$ is injective since for any $b \in B$ there
exists an $e \geq 0$ such that $b \in I^eB$, $b \not \in I^{e + 1}B$
by Krull's intersection theorem (Algebra, Lemma
\ref{algebra-lemma-intersect-powers-ideal-module-zero}).
This finishes the proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-algebraize-easy}
Let $I$ be an ideal of a Noetherian ring $A$. Let $C^h$ be the henselization
of a finite type $A$-algebra $C$ with respect to the ideal $IC$. Let
$J \subset C^h$ be an ideal. Then there exists a finite type $A$-algebra
$B$ such that $B^\wedge \cong (C^h/J)^\wedge$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By More on Algebra, Lemma
\ref{more-algebra-lemma-henselization-Noetherian-pair}
the ring $C^h$ is Noetherian. Say $J = (g_1, \ldots, g_m)$.
The ring $C^h$ is a filtered colimit of \'etale $C$ algebras $C'$
such that $C/IC \to C'/IC'$ is an isomorphism
(see proof of More on Algebra, Lemma \ref{more-algebra-lemma-henselization}).
Pick an $C'$ such that $g_1, \ldots, g_m$ are the
images of $g'_1, \ldots, g'_m \in C'$.
Setting $B = C'/(g'_1, \ldots, g'_m)$ we get a finite
type $A$-algebra. Of course $(C, IC)$ and $C', IC')$ have
the same henselizations and the same completions.
It follows easily from this that $B^\wedge = (C^h/J)^\wedge$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
\label{proposition-approximate}
Let $I$ be an ideal of a Noetherian G-ring $A$. Let $B$ be an
object of (\ref{equation-C-prime}). If $B$ is rig-smooth
over $(A, I)$, then there exists a finite type $A$-algebra
$C$ and an isomorphism $B \cong C^\wedge$ of $A$-algebras.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Choose a presentation $B = A[x_1, \ldots, x_r]^\wedge/J$. Write
$P = A[x_1, \ldots, x_r]^\wedge$. Choose generators $g_1, \ldots, g_m \in J$.
Choose generators $k_1, \ldots, k_t$ of the module
of relations between $g_1, \ldots, g_m$, i.e., such that
$$
P^{\oplus t} \xrightarrow{k_1, \ldots, k_t}
P^{\oplus m} \xrightarrow{g_1, \ldots, g_m}
P \to B \to 0
$$
is a resolution. Write $k_i = (k_{i1}, \ldots, k_{im})$ so that we have
\begin{equation}
\label{equation-relations-straight-up}
\sum\nolimits_j k_{ij}g_j = 0
\end{equation}
for $i = 1, \ldots, t$. Denote $K = (k_{ij})$ the $m \times t$-matrix
with entries $k_{ij}$.

\medskip\noindent
Let $A[x_1, \ldots, x_r]^h$ be the henselization of the
pair $(A[x_1, \ldots, x_r], IA[x_1, \ldots, x_r])$, see
More on Algebra, Lemma \ref{more-algebra-lemma-henselization}.
We may and do think of $A[x_1, \ldots, x_r]^h$ as a subring
of $P = A[x_1, \ldots, x_r]^\wedge$, see
More on Algebra, Lemma
\ref{more-algebra-lemma-henselization-Noetherian-pair}.
Since $A$ is a Noetherian G-ring, so is $A[x_1, \ldots, x_r]$, see
More on Algebra, Proposition
\ref{more-algebra-proposition-finite-type-over-G-ring}.
Hence we have approximation for the map
$A[x_1, \ldots, x_r]^h \to A[x_1, \ldots, x_r]^\wedge = P$
with respect to the ideal generated by $I$, see
Smoothing Ring Maps, Lemma \ref{smoothing-lemma-henselian-pair}.
Choose a large enough integer $n$ as in Lemma \ref{lemma-close-enough}.
By the approximation property we may choose
$g'_1, \ldots, g'_m \in A[x_1, \ldots, x_r]^h$
and a matrix
$K' = (k'_{ij}) \in \text{Mat}(m \times t, A[x_1, \ldots, x_r]^h)$
such that $\sum\nolimits_j k'_{ij}g'_j = 0$ in
$A[x_1, \ldots, x_r]^h$ and such that
$g_i - g'_i \in I^nP$ and $K - K' \in I^n\text{Mat}(m \times t, P)$.
By our choice of $n$ we conclude that there is an isomorphism
$$
B \to P/(g'_1, \ldots, g'_m) =
\left(A[x_1, \ldots, x_r]^h/(g'_1, \ldots, g'_m)\right)^\wedge
$$
This finishes the proof by Lemma \ref{lemma-algebraize-easy}.
\end{proof}

\noindent
The following lemma isn't true in general if $A$ is not a G-ring
but just Noetherian. Namely, if $(A, \mathfrak m)$ is local
and $I = \mathfrak m$, then the lemma is equivalent to 
Artin approximation for $A^h$ (as in
Smoothing Ring Maps, Theorem \ref{smoothing-theorem-approximation-property})
which does not hold for every Noetherian local ring.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-fully-faithfulness}
Let $A$ be a Noetherian G-ring. Let $I \subset A$ be an ideal.
Let $B, C$ be finite type $A$-algebras. For any $A$-algebra map
$\varphi : B^\wedge \to C^\wedge$ of $I$-adic completions and any
$N \geq 1$ there exist
\begin{enumerate}
\item an \'etale ring map $C \to C'$ which induces
an isomorphism $C/IC \to C'/IC'$,
\item an $A$-algebra map $\varphi : B \to C'$
\end{enumerate}
such that $\varphi$ and $\psi$ agree modulo $I^N$
into $C^\wedge = (C')^\wedge$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The statement of the lemma makes sense as $C \to C'$ is flat
(Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-etale}) hence induces an isomorphism
$C/I^nC \to C'/I^nC'$ for all $n$
(More on Algebra, Lemma \ref{more-algebra-lemma-neighbourhood-isomorphism})
and hence an isomorphism on completions.
Let $C^h$ be the henselization of the pair $(C, IC)$, see
More on Algebra, Lemma \ref{more-algebra-lemma-henselization}.
Then $C^h$ is the filtered colimit of the algebras $C'$
and the maps
$C \to C' \to C^h$ induce isomorphism on completions (More on Algebra,
Lemma \ref{more-algebra-lemma-henselization-Noetherian-pair}).
Thus it suffices to prove there exists an $A$-algebra map
$B \to C^h$ which is congruent to $\psi$ modulo $I^N$.
Write $B = A[x_1, \ldots, x_n]/(f_1, \ldots, f_m)$.
The ring map $\psi$ corresponds to elements
$\hat c_1, \ldots, \hat c_n \in C^\wedge$ with
$f_j(\hat c_1, \ldots, \hat c_n) = 0$ for $j = 1, \ldots, m$.
Namely, as $A$ is a Noetherian G-ring, so is $C$, see
More on Algebra, Proposition
\ref{more-algebra-proposition-finite-type-over-G-ring}.
Thus Smoothing Ring Maps,
Lemma \ref{smoothing-lemma-henselian-pair}
applies to give elements $c_1, \ldots, c_n \in C^h$ such
that $f_j(c_1, \ldots, c_n) = 0$ for $j = 1, \ldots, m$
and such that $\hat c_i - c_i \in I^NC^h$.
This determines the map $B \to C^h$ as desired.
\end{proof}







\section{Algebraization of rig-smooth algebras}
\label{section-algebraization-rig-smooth}

\noindent
It turns out that if the rig-smooth algebra has a specific presentation,
then it is straightforward to algebraize it. Please also see
Remark \ref{remark-discussion} for a discussion.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-presentation-rig-smooth}
Let $A$ be a ring. Let $f_1, \ldots, f_m \in A[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$
and set $B = A[x_1, \ldots, x_n]/(f_1, \ldots, f_m)$. Assume $m \leq n$
and set $g = \det_{1 \leq i, j \leq m}(\partial f_j/\partial x_i)$.
Then
\begin{enumerate}
\item $g$ annihilates $\Ext^1_B(\NL_{B/A}, N)$ for every $B$-module $N$,
\item if $n = m$, then multiplication by $g$ on $\NL_{B/A}$ is $0$ in $D(B)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $T$ be the $m \times m$ matrix with entries $\partial f_j/\partial x_i$
for $1 \leq i, j \leq n$. Let $K \in D(B)$ be represented by the complex
$T : B^{\oplus m} \to B^{\oplus m}$ with terms sitting in degrees $-1$ and $0$.
By More on Algebra, Lemmas \ref{more-algebra-lemma-silly}
we have $g : K \to K$ is zero in $D(B)$. Set $J = (f_1, \ldots, f_m)$.
Recall that $\NL_{B/A}$ is homotopy equivalent to
$J/J^2 \to \bigoplus_{i = 1, \ldots, n} B\text{d}x_i$, see
Algebra, Section \ref{algebra-section-netherlander}.
Denote $L$ the complex $J/J^2 \to \bigoplus_{i = 1, \ldots, m} B\text{d}x_i$
to that we have the quotient map $\NL_{B/A} \to L$.
We also have a surjective map of complexes $K \to L$
by sending the $j$th basis element in the term $B^{\oplus m}$
in degree $-1$ to the class of $f_j$ in $J/J^2$. Picture
$$
\NL_{B/A} \to L \leftarrow K
$$
From
More on Algebra, Lemma \ref{more-algebra-lemma-two-term-surjection-map-zero}
we conclude that multiplication by $g$ on $L$ is $0$ in $D(B)$.
On the other hand, the distinguished triangle
$B^{\oplus n - m}[0] \to \NL_{B/A} \to L$
shows that $\Ext^1_B(L, N) \to \Ext^1_B(\NL_{B/A}, N)$ is surjective
for every $B$-module $N$ and hence annihilated by $g$.
This proves part (1).
If $n = m$ then $\NL_{B/A} = L$ and we see that (2) holds.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-approximate-presentation-rig-smooth}
Let $I$ be an ideal of a Noetherian ring $A$. Let $B$ be an object
of (\ref{equation-C-prime}). Let $B = A[x_1, \ldots, x_r]^\wedge/J$
be a presentation. Assume there exists an element
$b \in B$, $0 \leq m \leq r$, and $f_1, \ldots, f_m \in J$
such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item $V(b) \subset V(IB)$ in $\Spec(B)$,
\item the image of
$\Delta = \det_{1 \leq i, j \leq m}(\partial f_j/\partial x_i)$
in $B$ divides $b$, and
\item $b J \subset (f_1, \ldots, f_m) + J^2$.
\end{enumerate}
Then there exists a finite type $A$-algebra $C$ and an $A$-algebra
isomorphism $B \cong C^\wedge$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The conditions imply that $B$ is rig-smooth over $(A, I)$, see
Lemma \ref{lemma-equivalent-with-artin-smooth}.
Write $b' \Delta = b$ in $B$ for some $b' \in B$.
Say $I = (a_1, \ldots, a_t)$. Since $V(b) \subset V(IB)$ there
exists an integer $c \geq 0$ such that $I^cB \subset bB$.
Write $bb_i = a_i^c$ in $B$ for some $b_i \in B$.

\medskip\noindent
Choose an integer $n \gg 0$ (we will see later how large).
Choose polynomials $f'_1, \ldots, f'_m \in A[x_1, \ldots, x_r]$
such that $f_i - f'_i \in I^nA[x_1, \ldots, x_r]^\wedge$.
We set $\Delta' = \det_{1 \leq i, j \leq m}(\partial f'_j/\partial x_i)$
and we consider the finite type $A$-algebra
$$
C = A[x_1, \ldots, x_r, z_1, \ldots, z_t]/
(f'_1, \ldots, f'_m,
z_1\Delta' - a_1^c, \ldots, z_t\Delta' - a_t^c)
$$
We will apply Lemma \ref{lemma-presentation-rig-smooth} to $C$.
We compute
$$
\det\left(
\begin{matrix}
\text{matrix of partials of} \\
f'_1, \ldots, f'_m, z_1\Delta' - a_1^c, \ldots, z_t\Delta' - a_t^c \\
\text{with respect to the variables} \\
x_1, \ldots, x_m, z_1, \ldots, z_t
\end{matrix}
\right) =
(\Delta')^{t + 1}
$$
Hence we see that $\Ext^1_C(\NL_{C/A}, N)$ is annihilated by
$(\Delta')^{t + 1}$ for all $C$-modules $N$. Since $a_i^c$ is
divisible by $\Delta'$ in $C$ we see that $a_i^{(t + 1)c}$ annihilates
these $\Ext^1$'s also. Thus $I^{c_1}$ annihilates
$\Ext^1_C(\NL_{C/A}, N)$ for all $C$-modules $N$
where $c_1 = 1 + t((t + 1)c - 1)$. The exact value of $c_1$ doesn't matter for
the rest of the argument; what matters is that it is independent of $n$.

\medskip\noindent
Since $\NL_{C^\wedge/A}^\wedge = \NL_{C/A} \otimes_C C^\wedge$ by
Lemma \ref{lemma-NL-is-completion} we conclude that multiplication
by $I^{c_1}$ is zero on $\Ext^1_{C^\wedge}(\NL_{C^\wedge/A}^\wedge, N)$
for any $C^\wedge$-module $N$ as well, see
More on Algebra, Lemmas
\ref{more-algebra-lemma-base-change-property-ext-1-annihilated} and
\ref{more-algebra-lemma-two-term-base-change}.
In particular $C^\wedge$ is rig-smooth over $(A, I)$.

\medskip\noindent
Observe that we have a surjective $A$-algebra homomorphism
$$
\psi_n : C \longrightarrow B/I^nB
$$
sending the class of $x_i$ to the class of $x_i$ and sending the class of
$z_i$ to the class of $b_ib'$. This works because of our choices of $b'$
and $b_i$ in the first paragraph of the proof.

\medskip\noindent
Let $d = d(\text{Gr}_I(B))$ and $q_0 = q(\text{Gr}_I(B))$ be the integers
found in 
Local Cohomology, Section \ref{local-cohomology-section-uniform}.
By Lemma \ref{lemma-get-morphism-general-better} if we take
$n \geq \max(q_0 + (d + 1)c_1, 2(d + 1)c_1 + 1)$ we can find a homomorphism
$\varphi : C^\wedge \to B$ of $A$-algebras which is congruent to
$\psi_n$ modulo $I^{n - (d + 1)c_1}B$.

\medskip\noindent
Since $\varphi : C^\wedge \to B$ is surjective modulo $I$
we see that it is surjective (for example use
Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-completion-generalities}).
To finish the proof it suffices to show that
$\Ker(\varphi)/\Ker(\varphi)^2$ is annihilated by a power of $I$, see
More on Algebra, Lemma \ref{more-algebra-lemma-quotient-by-idempotent}.

\medskip\noindent
Since $\varphi$ is surjective we see that
$\NL_{B/C^{\wedge}}^\wedge$ has cohomology modules
$H^0(\NL_{B/C^{\wedge}}^\wedge) = 0$ and
$H^{-1}(\NL_{B/C^{\wedge}}^\wedge) = \Ker(\varphi)/\Ker(\varphi)^2$.
We have an exact sequence
$$
H^{-1}(\NL_{C^\wedge/A}^\wedge \otimes_{C^\wedge} B) \to
H^{-1}(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge) \to
H^{-1}(\NL_{B/C^{\wedge}}^\wedge) \to
H^0(\NL_{C^\wedge/A}^\wedge \otimes_{C^\wedge} B) \to
H^0(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge) \to 0
$$
by Lemma \ref{lemma-exact-sequence-NL}. The first two modules are
annihilated by a power of $I$ as $B$ and $C^\wedge$ are rig-smooth over
$(A, I)$. Hence it suffices
to show that the kernel of the surjective map
$H^0(\NL_{C^\wedge/A}^\wedge \otimes_{C^\wedge} B) \to
H^0(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge)$ is annihilated by a power of $I$.
For this it suffices to show that it is annihilated by
a power of $b$. In other words, it suffices to show that
$$
H^0(\NL_{C^\wedge/A}^\wedge) \otimes_{C^\wedge} B[1/b]
\longrightarrow
H^0(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge) \otimes_B B[1/b]
$$
is an isomorphism. However, both are free $B[1/b]$ modules
of rank $r - m$ with basis $\text{d}x_{m + 1}, \ldots, \text{d}x_r$
and we conclude the proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
\label{remark-discussion}
Let $I$ be an ideal of a Noetherian ring $A$. Let $B$ be an object
of (\ref{equation-C-prime}) which is rig-smooth over $(A, I)$.
As far as we know, it is an open question as to whether $B$
is isomorphic to the $I$-adic completion of a finite type $A$-algebra.
Here are some things we do know:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $A$ is a G-ring, then the answer is yes by
Proposition \ref{proposition-approximate}.
\item If $B$ is rig-\'etale over $(A, I)$, then the answer is
yes by Lemma \ref{lemma-approximate}.
\item If $I$ is principal, then the answer is yes by
\cite[III Theorem 7]{Elkik}.
\item In general there exists an ideal $J = (b_1, \ldots, b_s) \subset B$
such that $V(J) \subset V(IB)$ and such that the $I$-adic completion of
each of the affine blowup algebras $B[\frac{J}{b_i}]$ are isomorphic
to the $I$-adic completion of a finite type $A$-algebra.
\end{enumerate}
To see the last statement, choose $b_1, \ldots, b_s$ as in
Lemma \ref{lemma-equivalent-with-artin-smooth} part (4)
and use the properties mentioned there to see that
Lemma \ref{lemma-approximate-presentation-rig-smooth}
applies to each completion $(B[\frac{J}{b_i}])^\wedge$.
Part (4) tells us that ``rig-locally a rig-smooth formal algebraic space is
the completion of a finite type scheme over $A$'' and it tells us that
``there is an admissible formal blowing up of $\text{Spf}(B)$
which is affine locally algebraizable''.
\end{remark}







\section{Rig-\'etale algebras}
\label{section-rig-etale}

\noindent
In view of our definition of rig-smooth algebras
(Definition \ref{definition-rig-smooth-homomorphism}),
the following definition should not come as a surprise.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-rig-etale-homomorphism}
Let $A$ be a Noetherian ring and let $I \subset A$ be an ideal.
Let $B$ be an object of (\ref{equation-C-prime}). We say
$B$ is {\it rig-\'etale over $(A, I)$} if there exists an integer
$c \geq 0$ such that for all $a \in I^c$
multiplication by $a$ on $\NL_{B/A}^\wedge$
is zero in $D(B)$.
\end{definition}

\noindent
Condition (\ref{item-condition-artin}) in the next lemma is
one of the conditions used in \cite{ArtinII} to define formal modifications.
We have added it to the list of conditions to facilitate comparison
with our conditions later on.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-equivalent-with-artin}
Let $A$ be a Noetherian ring and let $I \subset A$ be an ideal.
Let $B$ be an object of (\ref{equation-C-prime}). Write
$B = A[x_1, \ldots, x_r]^\wedge/J$
(Lemma \ref{lemma-topologically-finite-type-Noetherian})
and let $\NL_{B/A}^\wedge = (J/J^2 \to \bigoplus B\text{d}x_i)$
be its naive cotangent complex (\ref{equation-NL}).
The following are equivalent
\begin{enumerate}
\item $B$ is rig-\'etale over $(A, I)$,
\item
\label{item-zero-on-NL}
there exists a $c \geq 0$ such that for all $a \in I^c$ multiplication by $a$
on $\NL_{B/A}^\wedge$ is zero in $D(B)$,
\item
\label{item-zero-on-cohomology-NL}
there exits a $c \geq 0$ such that $H^i(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge)$, $i = -1, 0$ is
annihilated by $I^c$,
\item
\label{item-zero-on-cohomology-NL-truncations}
there exists a $c \geq 0$ such that $H^i(\NL_{B_n/A_n})$, $i = -1, 0$ is
annihilated by $I^c$ for all $n \geq 1$ where $A_n = A/I^n$ and $B_n = B/I^nB$,
\item
\label{item-condition-artin-pre-pre}
for every $a \in I$ there exists a $c \geq 0$ such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item $a^c$ annihilates $H^0(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge)$, and
\item there exist $f_1, \ldots, f_r \in J$ such that
$a^c J \subset (f_1, \ldots, f_r) + J^2$.
\end{enumerate}
\item
\label{item-condition-artin-pre}
for every $a \in I$ there exist $f_1, \ldots, f_r \in J$ and $c \geq 0$
such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\det_{1 \leq i, j \leq r}(\partial f_j/\partial x_i)$ divides
$a^c$ in $B$, and
\item $a^c J \subset (f_1, \ldots, f_r) + J^2$.
\end{enumerate}
\item
\label{item-condition-artin}
choosing generaters $f_1, \ldots, f_t$ for $J$ we have
\begin{enumerate}
\item the Jacobian ideal of $B$ over $A$, namely the ideal in $B$
generated by the $r \times r$ minors of the matrx
$(\partial f_j/\partial x_i)_{1 \leq i \leq r, 1 \leq j \leq t}$,
contains the ideal $I^cB$ for some $c$, and
\item the Cramer ideal of $B$ over $A$, namely the ideal in $B$
generated by the image in $B$ of the $r$th Fitting ideal of $J$
as an $A[x_1, \ldots, x_r]^\wedge$-module, contains $I^cB$ for some $c$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The equivalence of (1) and (\ref{item-zero-on-NL}) is a restatement of
Definition \ref{definition-rig-etale-homomorphism}.

\medskip\noindent
The equivalence of (\ref{item-zero-on-NL}) and
(\ref{item-zero-on-cohomology-NL}) follows from
More on Algebra, Lemma \ref{more-algebra-lemma-zero-in-derived}.

\medskip\noindent
The equivalence of (\ref{item-zero-on-cohomology-NL})
and (\ref{item-zero-on-cohomology-NL-truncations}) follows from the fact that
the systems $\{\NL_{B_n/A_n}\}$ and $\NL_{B/A}^\wedge \otimes_B B_n$
are strictly isomorphic, see Lemma \ref{lemma-NL-is-limit}.
Some details omitted.

\medskip\noindent
Assume (\ref{item-zero-on-NL}). Let $a \in I$.
Let $c$ be such that multiplication by $a^c$ is zero on $\NL_{B/A}^\wedge$. By
More on Algebra, Lemma \ref{more-algebra-lemma-map-out-of-almost-free}
part (1) there exists a map $\alpha : \bigoplus B\text{d}x_i \to J/J^2$
such that $\text{d} \circ \alpha$ and $\alpha \circ \text{d}$ are both
multiplication by $a^c$. Let $f_i \in J$ be an element whose
class modulo $J^2$ is equal to $\alpha(\text{d}x_i)$.
A simple calculation gives that (\ref{item-condition-artin-pre})(a), (b) hold.

\medskip\noindent
We omit the verification that (\ref{item-condition-artin-pre})
implies (\ref{item-condition-artin-pre-pre}); it is just a statement
on two term complexes over $B$ of the form $M \to B^{\oplus r}$.

\medskip\noindent
Assume (\ref{item-condition-artin-pre-pre}) holds.
Say $I = (a_1, \ldots, a_t)$. Let $c_i \geq 0$ be the integer such that
(\ref{item-condition-artin-pre-pre})(a), (b)
hold for $a_i^{c_i}$. Then we see that $I^{\sum c_i}$ annihilates
$H^0(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge)$. Let $f_{i, 1}, \ldots, f_{i, r} \in J$
be as in (\ref{item-condition-artin-pre-pre})(b) for $a_i$.
Consider the composition
$$
B^{\oplus r} \to J/J^2 \to \bigoplus B\text{d}x_i
$$
where the $j$th basis vector is mapped to the class of $f_{i, j}$ in $J/J^2$.
By (\ref{item-condition-artin-pre-pre})(a) and (b) the cokernel of the
composition is annihilated by $a_i^{2c_i}$. Thus this map is surjective
after inverting $a_i^{c_i}$, and hence an isomorphism
(Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-fun}).
Thus the kernel of $B^{\oplus r} \to \bigoplus B\text{d}x_i$ is
$a_i$-power torsion, and hence
$H^{-1}(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge) = \Ker(J/J^2 \to \bigoplus B\text{d}x_i)$
is $a_i$-power torsion. Since $B$ is Noetherian
(Lemma \ref{lemma-topologically-finite-type-Noetherian}),
all modules including $H^{-1}(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge)$ are finite.
Thus $a_i^{d_i}$ annihilates $H^{-1}(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge)$ for some $d_i \geq 0$.
It follows that $I^{\sum d_i}$ annihilates $H^{-1}(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge)$
and we see that (\ref{item-zero-on-cohomology-NL}) holds.

\medskip\noindent
Thus conditions
(\ref{item-zero-on-NL}),
(\ref{item-zero-on-cohomology-NL}),
(\ref{item-zero-on-cohomology-NL-truncations}),
(\ref{item-condition-artin-pre-pre}), and
(\ref{item-condition-artin-pre}) are equivalent.
Thus it remains to show that these conditions are
equivalent with (\ref{item-condition-artin}).
Observe that the Cramer ideal $\text{Fit}_r(J) B$ is
equal to $\text{Fit}_r(J/J^2)$ as
$J/J^2 = J \otimes_{A[x_1, \ldots, x_r]^\wedge} B$, see
More on Algebra, Lemma \ref{more-algebra-lemma-fitting-ideal-basics} part (3).
Also, observe that the Jacobian ideal is just
$\text{Fit}_0(H^0(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge))$.
Thus we see that the equivalence of
(\ref{item-zero-on-cohomology-NL}) and (\ref{item-condition-artin})
is a purely algebraic question which we discuss in the next paragraph.

\medskip\noindent
Let $R$ be a Noetherian ring and let $I \subset R$ be an ideal.
Let $M \xrightarrow{d} R^{\oplus r}$ be a two term complex.
We have to show that the following are equivalent
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(A)] the cohomology of $M \to R^{\oplus r}$ is annihilated by a power
of $I$, and
\item[(B)] the ideals $\text{Fit}_r(M)$ and $\text{Fit}_0(\text{Coker}(d))$
contain a power of $I$.
\end{enumerate}
Since $R$ is Noetherian, we can reformulate part (2) as an inclusion
of the corresponding closed subschemes, see Algebra, Lemmas
\ref{algebra-lemma-Zariski-topology} and \ref{algebra-lemma-Noetherian-power}.
On the other hand, over the complement of $V(\text{Fit}_0(\Coker(d)))$
the cokernel of $d$ vanishes and over the complement of
$V(\text{Fit}_r(M))$ the module $M$ is locally generated by $r$
elements, see
More on Algebra, Lemma \ref{more-algebra-lemma-fitting-ideal-generate-locally}.
Thus (B) is equivalent to
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(C)] away from $V(I)$ the cokernel of $d$ vanishes and
the module $M$ is locally generated by $\leq r$ elements.
\end{enumerate}
Of course this is equivalent to the condition that $M \to R^{\oplus r}$
has vanishing cohomology over $\Spec(R) \setminus V(I)$ which in turn
is equivalent to (A). This finishes the proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-rig-etale-rig-smooth}
Let $A$ be a Noetherian ring and let $I$ be an ideal.
Let $B$ be an object of (\ref{equation-C-prime}).
If $B$ is rig-\'etale over $(A, I)$, then $B$ is rig-smooth over $(A, I)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Immediate from Definitions \ref{definition-rig-smooth-homomorphism} and
\ref{definition-rig-etale-homomorphism}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-rig-etale}
Let $A$ be a Noetherian ring and let $I$ be an ideal.
Let $B$ be a finite type $A$-algebra.
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $\Spec(B) \to \Spec(A)$ is \'etale over $\Spec(A) \setminus V(I)$,
then $B^\wedge$ satisfies the equivalent conditions of
Lemma \ref{lemma-equivalent-with-artin}.
\item If $B^\wedge$ satisfies the equivalent conditions of
Lemma \ref{lemma-equivalent-with-artin},
then there exists $g \in 1 + IB$ such that $\Spec(B_g)$ is \'etale
over $\Spec(A) \setminus V(I)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Assume $B^\wedge$ satisfies the equivalent conditions of
Lemma \ref{lemma-equivalent-with-artin}.
The naive cotangent complex $\NL_{B/A}$ is a complex of finite type
$B$-modules and hence $H^{-1}$ and $H^0$ are finite $B$-modules.
Completion is an exact functor on finite $B$-modules (Algebra,
Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-completion-flat}) and $\NL_{B^\wedge/A}^\wedge$
is the completion of the complex $\NL_{B/A}$ (this is easy to see
by choosing presentations).
Hence the assumption implies there exists a $c \geq 0$ such that
$H^{-1}/I^nH^{-1}$ and $H^0/I^nH^0$ are annihilated by $I^c$
for all $n$. By Nakayama's lemma (Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-NAK})
this means that $I^cH^{-1}$ and $I^cH^0$ are annihilated by an element
of the form $g = 1 + x$ with $x \in IB$. After inverting $g$
(which does not change the quotients $B/I^nB$)
we see that $\NL_{B/A}$ has cohomology annihilated by $I^c$. Thus
$A \to B$ is \'etale at any prime of $B$ not lying over $V(I)$
by the definition of \'etale ring maps, see
Algebra, Definition \ref{algebra-definition-etale}.

\medskip\noindent
Conversely, assume that $\Spec(B) \to \Spec(A)$ is \'etale over
$\Spec(A) \setminus V(I)$. Then for every $a \in I$ there exists
a $c \geq 0$ such that multiplication by $a^c$ is zero $\NL_{B/A}$.
Since $\NL_{B^\wedge/A}^\wedge$ is the derived completion of
$\NL_{B/A}$ (see Lemma \ref{lemma-NL-is-limit}) it follows that
$B^\wedge$ satisfies the equivalent conditions of
Lemma \ref{lemma-equivalent-with-artin}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-zero-after-modding-out}
Let $(A_1, I_1) \to (A_2, I_2)$ be as in
Remark \ref{remark-base-change} with $A_1$ and $A_2$ Noetherian.
Let $B_1$ be in (\ref{equation-C-prime}) for $(A_1, I_1)$.
Let $B_2$ be the base change of $B_1$.
If multiplication by $f_1 \in B_1$ on $\NL^\wedge_{B_1/A_1}$
is zero in $D(B_1)$, then multiplication by
the image $f_2 \in B_2$ on $\NL^\wedge_{B_2/A_2}$ is zero
in $D(B_2)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By Lemma \ref{lemma-NL-base-change} there is a map
$$
\NL_{B_1/A_1} \otimes_{B_2} B_1 \to \NL_{B_2/A_2}
$$
which induces and isomorphism on $H^0$ and a surjection on $H^{-1}$.
Thus the result by
More on Algebra, Lemma \ref{more-algebra-lemma-two-term-surjection-map-zero}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-base-change-rig-etale-homomorphism}
Let $A_1 \to A_2$ be a map of Noetherian rings. Let $I_i \subset A_i$
be an ideal such that $V(I_1A_2) = V(I_2)$. Let $B_1$ be in
(\ref{equation-C-prime}) for $(A_1, I_1)$.
Let $B_2$ be the base change of $B_1$ as in
Remark \ref{remark-base-change}.
If $B_1$ is rig-\'etale over $(A_1, I_1)$,
then $B_2$ is rig-\'etale over $(A_2, I_2)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Follows from Lemma \ref{lemma-zero-after-modding-out} and
Definition \ref{definition-rig-etale-homomorphism} and the fact
that $I_2^c \subset I_1A_2$ for some $c \geq 0$ as $A_2$ is Noetherian.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-fully-faithful-etale-over-complement}
Let $A$ be a Noetherian ring. Let $I \subset A$ be an ideal.
Let $B$ be a finite type $A$-algebra such that
$\Spec(B) \to \Spec(A)$ is \'etale over $\Spec(A) \setminus V(I)$.
Let $C$ be a Noetherian $A$-algebra. Then any $A$-algebra
map $B^\wedge \to C^\wedge$ of $I$-adic completions
comes from a unique $A$-algebra map
$$
B \longrightarrow C^h
$$
where $C^h$ is the henselization of the pair $(C, IC)$ as
in More on Algebra, Lemma \ref{more-algebra-lemma-henselization}.
Moreover, any $A$-algebra homomorphism $B \to C^h$ factors through
some \'etale $C$-algebra $C'$ such that $C/IC \to C'/IC'$ is an isomorphism.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Uniqueness follows from the fact that $C^h$ is a subring of
$C^\wedge$, see for example
More on Algebra, Lemma \ref{more-algebra-lemma-henselization-Noetherian-pair}.
The final assertion follows from the fact that $C^h$ is the filtered colimit
of these $C$-algebras $C'$, see proof of
More on Algebra, Lemma \ref{more-algebra-lemma-henselization}.
Having said this we now turn to the proof of existence.

\medskip\noindent
Let $\varphi : B^\wedge \to C^\wedge$ be the given map.
This defines a section
$$
\sigma : (B \otimes_A C)^\wedge \longrightarrow C^\wedge
$$
of the completion of the map $C \to B \otimes_A C$. We may
replace $(A, I, B, C, \varphi)$ by $(C, IC, B \otimes_A C, C, \sigma)$.
In this way we see that we may assume that $A = C$.

\medskip\noindent
Proof of existence in the case $A = C$. In this case the map
$\varphi : B^\wedge \to A^\wedge$ is necessarily surjective.
By Lemmas \ref{lemma-rig-etale} and \ref{lemma-exact-sequence-NL}
we see that the cohomology groups of
$\NL_{A^\wedge/\!_\varphi B^\wedge}^\wedge$
are annihilated by a power of $I$. Since $\varphi$ is surjective,
this implies that $\Ker(\varphi)/\Ker(\varphi)^2$ is annihilated
by a power of $I$. Hence $\varphi : B^\wedge \to A^\wedge$
is the completion of a finite type $B$-algebra $B \to D$, see
More on Algebra, Lemma \ref{more-algebra-lemma-quotient-by-idempotent}.
Hence $A \to D$ is a finite type algebra map which induces an isomorphism
$A^\wedge \to D^\wedge$. By
Lemma \ref{lemma-rig-etale} we may replace $D$ by a localization
and assume that $A \to D$ is \'etale away from $V(I)$.
Since $A^\wedge \to D^\wedge$ is an isomorphism, we see that
$\Spec(D) \to \Spec(A)$ is also \'etale in a neighbourhood of $V(ID)$
(for example by
More on Morphisms, Lemma
\ref{more-morphisms-lemma-check-smoothness-on-infinitesimal-nbhds}).
Thus $\Spec(D) \to \Spec(A)$ is \'etale. Therefore $D$ maps to
$A^h$ and the lemma is proved.
\end{proof}
















\section{A pushout argument}
\label{section-approximation}

\noindent
The only goal in this section is to prove the following lemma which
will play a key role in algebraization of rig-\'etale algebras.
We will use a bit of the theory of algebraic spaces to prove this lemma;
an earlier version of this chapter gave a (much longer) proof using algebra
and a bit of deformation theory that the interested reader can find in
the history of the Stacks project.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-lift-approximation}
Let $A$ be a Noetherian ring and $I \subset A$ an ideal.
Let $J \subset A$ be a nilpotent ideal. Consider a commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
C \ar[r] & C_0 \ar@{=}[r] & C/JC \\
& B_0 \ar[u] \\
A \ar[r] \ar[uu] & A_0 \ar[u] \ar@{=}[r] & A/J
}
$$
whose vertical arrows are of finite type such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\Spec(C) \to \Spec(A)$ is \'etale over $\Spec(A) \setminus V(I)$,
\item $\Spec(B_0) \to \Spec(A_0)$ is \'etale over
$\Spec(A_0) \setminus V(IA_0)$, and
\item $B_0 \to C_0$ is \'etale and induces an isomorphism
$B_0/IB_0 = C_0/IC_0$.
\end{enumerate}
Then we can fill in the diagram above to a commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
C \ar[r] & C/JC \\
B \ar[u] \ar[r] & B_0 \ar[u] \\
A \ar[r] \ar[u] & A/J \ar[u]
}
$$
with $A \to B$ of finite type, $B/JB = B_0$, $B \to C$ \'etale, and
$\Spec(B) \to \Spec(A)$ \'etale over $\Spec(A) \setminus V(I)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Set $X = \Spec(A)$, $X_0 = \Spec(A_0)$, $Y_0 = \Spec(B_0)$,
$Z = \Spec(C)$, $Z_0 = \Spec(C_0)$. Furthermore, denote
$U \subset X$, $U_0 \subset X_0$, $V_0 \subset Y_0$,
$W \subset Z$, $W_0 \subset Z_0$ the complement of the
vanishing set of $I$. Here is a picture to help visualize the
situation:
$$
\xymatrix{
Z \ar[dd] & Z_0 \ar[l] \ar[d] \\
& Y_0 \ar[d] \\
X & X_0 \ar[l]
}
\quad\quad\quad
\xymatrix{
W \ar[dd] & W_0 \ar[l] \ar[d] \\
& V_0 \ar[d] \\
U & U_0 \ar[l]
}
$$
The conditions in the lemma guarantee that
$$
\xymatrix{
W_0 \ar[r] \ar[d] & Z_0 \ar[d] \\
V_0 \ar[r] & Y_0
}
$$
is an elementary distinguished square, see
Derived Categories of Spaces, Definition
\ref{spaces-perfect-definition-elementary-distinguished-square}.
In addition we know that
$W_0 \to U_0$ and $V_0 \to U_0$ are \'etale. The morphism
$X_0 \subset X$ is a finite order thickening as $J$ is assumed nilpotent.
By the topological invariance of the \'etale site
we can find a unique \'etale morphism $V \to X$ of schemes
with $V_0 = V \times_X X_0$ and we can lift the given morphism
$W_0 \to V_0$ to a unique morphism $W \to V$ over $X$.
See \'Etale Morphisms, Theorem
\ref{etale-theorem-remarkable-equivalence}.
Since $W_0 \to V_0$ is separated, the morphism $W \to V$ is separated too,
see for example
More on Morphisms, Lemma \ref{more-morphisms-lemma-deform-property}.
By Pushouts of Spaces, Lemma
\ref{spaces-pushouts-lemma-construct-elementary-distinguished-square}
we can construct an elementary distinguished square
$$
\xymatrix{
W \ar[r] \ar[d] & Z \ar[d] \\
V \ar[r] & Y
}
$$
in the category of algebraic spaces over $X$. Since the base change
of an elementary distinguished square is an elementary distinguished
square (Derived Categories of Spaces, Lemma
\ref{spaces-perfect-lemma-make-more-elementary-distinguished-squares})
we see that
$$
\xymatrix{
W_0 \ar[r] \ar[d] & Z_0 \ar[d] \\
V_0 \ar[r] & Y \times_X X_0
}
$$
is an elementary distinguished square. It follows that there is a
unique isomorphism $Y \times_X X_0 = Y_0$ compatible with the two
squares involving these spaces because
elementary distinguished squares are pushouts (Pushouts of Spaces, Lemma
\ref{spaces-pushouts-lemma-elementary-distinguished-square-pushout}).
It follows that $Y$ is affine by
Limits of Spaces, Proposition \ref{spaces-limits-proposition-affine}.
Write $Y = \Spec(B)$. It is clear that $B$ fits into the desired diagram
and satisfies all the properties required of it.
\end{proof}

















\section{Algebraization of rig-\'etale algebras}
\label{section-approximation-principal}

\noindent
The main goal is to prove algebraization for rig-\'etale algebras
when the underlying Noetherian ring $A$ is not assumed to be a G-ring
and when the ideal $I \subset A$ is arbitrary -- not necessarily principal.
We first prove the principal ideal case and then use the result
of Section \ref{section-approximation} to finish the proof.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-approximate-principal}
\begin{reference}
The rig-\'etale case of \cite[III Theorem 7]{Elkik}
\end{reference}
Let $A$ be a Noetherian ring and $I = (a)$ a principal ideal.
Let $B$ be an object of (\ref{equation-C-prime}) which is
rig-\'etale over $(A, I)$.
Then there exists a finite type $A$-algebra $C$ and an
isomorphism $B \cong C^\wedge$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Choose a presentation $B = A[x_1, \ldots, x_r]^\wedge/J$.
By Lemma \ref{lemma-equivalent-with-artin} part (6) we can find
$c \geq 0$ and $f_1, \ldots, f_r \in J$ such that
$\det_{1 \leq i, j \leq r}(\partial f_j/\partial x_i)$ divides
$a^c$ in $B$ and
$a^c J \subset (f_1, \ldots, f_r) + J^2$.
Hence Lemma \ref{lemma-approximate-presentation-rig-smooth} applies.
This finishes the proof, but we'd like to point out that in
this case the use of
Lemma \ref{lemma-get-morphism-general-better}
can be replaced by the much easier
Lemma \ref{lemma-get-morphism-principal}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-approximate}
Let $A$ be a Noetherian ring. Let $I \subset A$ be an ideal.
Let $B$ be an object of (\ref{equation-C-prime}) which is
rig-\'etale over $(A, I)$.
Then there exists a finite type $A$-algebra $C$ and an
isomorphism $B \cong C^\wedge$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We prove this lemma by induction on the number of generators of $I$.
Say $I = (a_1, \ldots, a_t)$. If $t = 0$, then $I = 0$ and there
is nothing to prove. If $t = 1$, then the lemma follows from
Lemma \ref{lemma-approximate-principal}. Assume $t > 1$.

\medskip\noindent
For any $m \geq 1$ set $\bar A_m = A/(a_t^m)$. Consider the ideal
$\bar I_m = (\bar a_1, \ldots, \bar a_{t - 1})$ in $\bar A_m$.
Observe that $V(I \bar A_m) = V(\bar I_m)$.
Let $B_m = B/(a_t^m)$ be the base change of $B$ for the
map $(A, I) \to (\bar A_m, \bar I_m)$, see Remark \ref{remark-take-bar}.
By Lemma \ref{lemma-base-change-rig-etale-homomorphism}
we find that $B_m$ is rig-\'etale over $(\bar A_m, \bar I_m)$.

\medskip\noindent
By induction hypothesis (on $t$) we can find a finite type
$\bar A_m$-algebra $C_m$ and a map $C_m \to B_m$ which induces an
isomorphism $C_m^\wedge \cong B_m$
where the completion is with respect to $\bar I_m$.
By Lemma \ref{lemma-rig-etale} we may assume that
$\Spec(C_m) \to \Spec(\bar A_m)$ is \'etale
over $\Spec(\bar A_m) \setminus V(\bar I_m)$.

\medskip\noindent
We claim that we may choose $A_m \to C_m \to B_m$ as in the previous
paragraph such that moreover there are isomorphisms
$C_m/(a_t^{m - 1}) \to C_{m - 1}$ compatible with the given
$A$-algebra structure and the maps to $B_{m - 1} = B_m/(a_t^{m - 1})$.
Namely, first fix a choice of $A_1 \to C_1 \to B_1$.
Suppose we have found $C_{m - 1} \to C_{m - 2} \to \ldots \to C_1$
with the desired properties.
Note that $C_m/(a_t^{m - 1})$ is \'etale over
$\Spec(\bar A_{m - 1}) \setminus V(\bar I_{m - 1})$.
Hence by Lemma \ref{lemma-fully-faithful-etale-over-complement}
there exists an \'etale extension $C_{m - 1} \to C'_{m - 1}$
which induces an isomorphism modulo $\bar I_{m - 1}$ and an
$\bar A_{m - 1}$-algebra map $C_m/(a_t^{m - 1}) \to C'_{m - 1}$
inducing the isomorphism $B_m/(a_t^{m - 1}) \to B_{m - 1}$ on completions.
Note that $C_m/(a_t^{m - 1}) \to C'_{m - 1}$ is \'etale over the complement
of $V(\bar I_{m - 1})$ by
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-etale-permanence}
and over $V(\bar I_{m - 1})$ induces an isomorphism on completions
hence is \'etale there too (for example by More on Morphisms, Lemma
\ref{more-morphisms-lemma-check-smoothness-on-infinitesimal-nbhds}).
Thus $C_m/(a_t^{m - 1}) \to C'_{m - 1}$ is \'etale. By the
topological invariance of \'etale morphisms
(\'Etale Morphisms, Theorem \ref{etale-theorem-remarkable-equivalence})
there exists an \'etale ring map $C_m \to C'_m$ such that
$C_m/(a_t^{m - 1}) \to C'_{m - 1}$ is isomorphic to
$C_m/(a_t^{m - 1}) \to C'_m/(a_t^{m - 1})$. Observe that the
$\bar I_m$-adic completion of $C'_m$ is equal to the $\bar I_m$-adic
completion of $C_m$, i.e., to $B_m$ (details omitted).
We apply Lemma \ref{lemma-lift-approximation} to the diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
 & C'_m \ar[r] & C'_m/(a_t^{m - 1}) \\
C''_m \ar@{..>}[ru] \ar@{..>}[rr] & & C_{m - 1} \ar[u] \\
 & \bar A_m \ar[r] \ar[uu] \ar@{..>}[lu] & \bar A_{m - 1} \ar[u]
}
$$
to see that there exists a ``lift'' of $C''_m$ of $C_{m - 1}$
to an algebra over $\bar A_m$ with all the desired properties.

\medskip\noindent
By construction $(C_m)$ is an object of the category
(\ref{equation-C}) for the principal ideal $(a_t)$.
Thus the inverse limit $B' = \lim C_m$ is an $(a_t)$-adically
complete $A$-algebra such that $B'/a_t B'$ is of finite type
over $A/(a_t)$, see Lemma \ref{lemma-topologically-finite-type}.
By construction the $I$-adic completion of $B'$ is isomorphic to $B$
(details omitted). Consider the complex $\NL_{B'/A}^\wedge$ constructed
using the $(a_t)$-adic topology. Choosing a presentation for $B'$
(which induces a similar presentation for $B$) the reader immediately
sees that $\NL_{B'/A}^\wedge \otimes_{B'} B = \NL_{B/A}^\wedge$.
Since $a_t \in I$ and since the cohomology modules of
$\NL_{B'/A}^\wedge$ are finite $B'$-modules (hence complete for the
$a_t$-adic topology), we conclude that $a_t^c$ acts as zero on
these cohomologies as the same thing is true by assumption for
$\NL_{B/A}^\wedge$. Thus $B'$ is rig-\'etale over $(A, (a_t))$
by Lemma \ref{lemma-equivalent-with-artin}.
Hence finally, we may apply Lemma \ref{lemma-approximate-principal}
to $B'$ over $(A, (a_t))$ to finish the proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-approximate-by-etale-over-complement}
Let $A$ be a Noetherian ring. Let $I \subset A$ be an ideal.
Let $B$ be an $I$-adically complete $A$-algebra with $A/I \to B/IB$
of finite type. The equivalent conditions of
Lemma \ref{lemma-equivalent-with-artin} are also equivalent to
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(8)]
\label{item-algebraize}
there exists a finite type $A$-algebra $C$ such that
$\Spec(C) \to \Spec(A)$ is \'etale over $\Spec(A) \setminus V(I)$
and such that $B \cong C^\wedge$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Combine Lemmas \ref{lemma-equivalent-with-artin}, \ref{lemma-approximate}, and
\ref{lemma-rig-etale}. Small detail omitted.

\section{Finite type morphisms}
\label{section-finite-type}

\noindent
In this section we review what we know about morphisms of locally adic*
formal algebraic spaces which are locally of finite type. This will in
particar pertain to locally Noetherian formal algebraic spaces, which
are our main target in this chapter.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-finite-type}
Let $A$ and $B$ be adic topological rings which have a finitely generated
ideal of definition. Let $\varphi : A \to B$ be a continuous ring homomorphism.
The following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\varphi$ is adic and $B$ is topologically of finite type over $A$,
\item $\varphi$ is taut and $B$ is topologically of finite type over $A$,
\item there exists an ideal of definition $I \subset A$ such that
the topology on $B$ is the $I$-adic topology and there exist an ideal
of definition $I' \subset A$ such that $A/I' \to B/I'B$ is of finite type,
\item for all ideals of definition $I \subset A$ the topology on $B$
is the $I$-adic topology and $A/I \to B/IB$ is of finite type,
\item there exists an ideal of definition $I \subset A$ such that
the topology on $B$ is the $I$-adic topology and $B$ is in the category
(\ref{equation-C-prime}),
\item for all ideals of definition $I \subset A$ the topology on $B$
is the $I$-adic topology and $B$ is in the category (\ref{equation-C-prime}),
\item $B$ as a topological $A$-algebra is the quotient of
$A\{x_1, \ldots, x_r\}$ by a closed ideal,
\item $B$ as a topological $A$-algebra is the quotient of
$A[x_1, \ldots, x_r]^\wedge$ by a closed ideal where
$A[x_1, \ldots, x_r]^\wedge$ is the completion of $A[x_1, \ldots, x_r]$
with respect to some ideal of definition of $A$, and
\item add more here.
\end{enumerate}
Moreover, these equivalent conditions define
a local property of morphisms of $\text{WAdm}^{adic*}$ as defined in
Formal Algebraic Spaces, Remark \ref{formal-spaces-remark-variant-adic-star}.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Taut ring homomorphisms are defined in
Formal Algebraic Spaces, Definition \ref{formal-spaces-definition-taut}.
Adic ring homomorphisms are defined in
Formal Algebraic Spaces, Definition
\ref{formal-spaces-definition-adic-homomorphism}.
The lemma follows from a combination of
Formal Algebraic Spaces, Lemmas
\ref{formal-spaces-lemma-quotient-restricted-power-series},
\ref{formal-spaces-lemma-quotient-restricted-power-series-admissible}, and
\ref{formal-spaces-lemma-adic-homomorphism}. We omit the details.
To be sure, there is no difference between the topological rings
$A[x_1, \ldots, x_n]^\wedge$ and $A\{x_1, \ldots, x_r\}$, see
Formal Algebraic Spaces, Remark
\ref{formal-spaces-remark-I-adic-completion-and-restricted-power-series}.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
\label{remark-NL-well-defined-topological}
Let $A \to B$ be an arrow of $\text{WAdm}^{adic*}$ satisfying the equivalent
conditions of Lemma \ref{lemma-finite-type}. Write
$B = A\{x_1, \ldots, x_r\}/J$. Then we can set\footnote{In fact, this
construction works for arrows of $\text{WAdm}^{count}$ satisfying the
equivalent conditions of Formal Algebraic Spaces, Lemma
\ref{formal-spaces-lemma-quotient-restricted-power-series}.}
$$
\NL_{B/A}^\wedge = \left(J/J^2 \longrightarrow \bigoplus B\text{d}x_i\right)
$$
Exactly as in the proof of Lemma \ref{lemma-NL-up-to-homotopy}
the reader can show that this complex of $B$-modules is
well defined up to (unique isomorphism) in the homotopy category $K(B)$.
Now, if $A$ is Noetherian and $I \subset A$ is an ideal of definition,
then this construction reproduces the naive cotangent complex
of $B$ over $(A, I)$ defined by Equation (\ref{equation-NL})
in Section \ref{section-naive-cotangent-complex} simply because
$A[x_1, \ldots, x_n]^\wedge$ agrees with $A\{x_1, \ldots, x_r\}$ by
Formal Algebraic Spaces, Remark
\ref{formal-spaces-remark-I-adic-completion-and-restricted-power-series}.
In particular, we find that, still when $A$ is an adic Noetherian
topological ring, the object $\NL_{B/A}^\wedge$ is independent
of the choice of the ideal of definition $I \subset A$.
\end{remark}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-base-change-finite-type}
Consider the property $P$ on arrows of $\textit{WAdm}^{adic*}$ defined in
Lemma \ref{lemma-finite-type}. Then $P$ is stable under base change as
defined in Formal Spaces, Remark
\ref{formal-spaces-remark-base-change-variant-adic-star}.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The statement makes sense by Lemma \ref{lemma-finite-type}.
To see that it is true assume we have morphisms
$B \to A$ and $B \to C$ in $\textit{WAdm}^{adic*}$
and that as a topological $B$-algebra we have
$A = B\{x_1, \ldots, x_r\}/J$ for some closed ideal $J$.
Then $A \widehat{\otimes}_B C$ is isomorphic to the
quotient of $C\{x_1, \ldots, x_r\}/J'$ where
$J'$ is the closure of $JC\{x_1, \ldots, x_r\}$.
Some details omitted.
\end{proof}

\noindent
The following lemma says that morphisms of adic* formal algebraic spaces
are locally of finite type if and only if they are \'etale locally given
by the types of maps of topological rings described in
Lemma \ref{lemma-finite-type}.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-finite-type-morphisms}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of
locally adic* formal algebraic spaces over $S$.
The following are equivalent
\begin{enumerate}
\item for every commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
U \ar[d] \ar[r] & V \ar[d] \\
X \ar[r] & Y
}
$$
with $U$ and $V$ affine formal algebraic spaces, $U \to X$ and $V \to Y$
representable by algebraic spaces and \'etale, the morphism $U \to V$
corresponds to a morphism of $\textit{WAdm}^{adic*}$ which is
adic and topologically of finite type,
\item there exists a covering $\{Y_j \to Y\}$ as in
Formal Algebraic Spaces,
Definition \ref{formal-spaces-definition-formal-algebraic-space}
and for each $j$
a covering $\{X_{ji} \to Y_j \times_Y X\}$ as in
Formal Algebraic Spaces,
Definition \ref{formal-spaces-definition-formal-algebraic-space}
such that each $X_{ji} \to Y_j$  corresponds
to a morphism of $\textit{WAdm}^{adic*}$ which is adic and
topologically of finite type,
\item there exist a covering $\{X_i \to X\}$ as in
Formal Algebraic Spaces,
Definition \ref{formal-spaces-definition-formal-algebraic-space}
and for each $i$ a factorization $X_i \to Y_i \to Y$ where $Y_i$
is an affine formal algebraic space, $Y_i \to Y$ is representable
by algebraic spaces and \'etale, and $X_i \to Y_i$ corresponds
to a morphism of $\textit{WAdm}^{adic*}$ which is adic and topologically
of finite type, and
\item $f$ is locally of finite type.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Immediate consequence of the equivalence of (1) and (2) in
Lemma \ref{lemma-finite-type} and
Formal Algebraic Spaces, Lemma
\ref{formal-spaces-lemma-finite-type-local-property}.
\end{proof}










\section{Finite type on reductions}
\label{section-finite-type-red}

\noindent
In this section we review what we know about morphisms $X \to Y$
of locally countably indexed formal algebraic spaces such that
$X_{red} \to Y_{red}$ is locally of finite type.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-finite-type-red}
For a morphism $\varphi : A \to B$ in $\text{WAdm}^{count}$ consider
the property $P(\varphi)=$``the induced ring homomorphism
$A/\mathfrak a \to B/\mathfrak b$ is of finite type''
where $\mathfrak a \subset A$ and $\mathfrak b \subset B$ are the ideals
of topologically nilpotent elements. Then $P$ is a local property
as defined in
Formal Algebraic Spaces, Situation
\ref{formal-spaces-situation-local-property}.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Consider a commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
B \ar[r] & (B')^\wedge \\
A \ar[r] \ar[u]^\varphi & (A')^\wedge \ar[u]_{\varphi'}
}
$$
as in Formal Algebraic Spaces, Situation
\ref{formal-spaces-situation-local-property}.
Taking $\text{Spf}$ of this diagram we obtain
$$
\xymatrix{
\text{Spf}(B) \ar[d] &
\text{Spf}((B')^\wedge) \ar[l] \ar[d] \\
\text{Spf}(A) &
\text{Spf}((A')^\wedge) \ar[l]
}
$$
of affine formal algebraic spaces whose horizontal arrows are
representable by algebraic spaces and \'etale by
Formal Algebraic Spaces, Lemma \ref{formal-spaces-lemma-etale}.
Hence we obtain a commutative diagram of affine schemes
$$
\xymatrix{
\text{Spf}(B)_{red} \ar[d]^f &
\text{Spf}((B')^\wedge)_{red} \ar[l]^g \ar[d]^{f'} \\
\text{Spf}(A)_{red} &
\text{Spf}((A')^\wedge)_{red} \ar[l]
}
$$
whose horizontal arrows are \'etale by
Formal Algebraic Spaces, Lemma \ref{formal-spaces-lemma-reduction-smooth}.
By Formal Algebraic Spaces, Example
\ref{formal-spaces-example-reduction-affine-formal-spectrum} and
Lemma \ref{formal-spaces-lemma-etale-surjective}
conditions (1), (2), and (3) of
Formal Algebraic Spaces, Situation
\ref{formal-spaces-situation-local-property}
translate into the following statements
\begin{enumerate}
\item if $f$ is locally of finite type, then $f'$ is locally of finite type,
\item if $f'$ is locally of finite type and $g$ is surjective, then
$f$ is locally of finite type, and
\item if $T_i \to S$, $i = 1, \ldots, n$ are locally of finite type, then
$\coprod_{i = 1, \ldots, n} T_i \to S$ is locally of finite type.
\end{enumerate}
Properties (1) and (2) follow from the fact that being locally
of finite type is local on the source and target in the
\'etale topology (see for example the discussion in
Morphisms of Spaces, Section \ref{spaces-morphisms-section-finite-type}).
Property (3) is immediate from the definition.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-base-change-finite-type-red}
Consider the property $P$ on arrows of $\textit{WAdm}^{count}$ defined in
Lemma \ref{lemma-finite-type-red}. Then $P$ is stable under base change
(Formal Spaces, Situation
\ref{formal-spaces-situation-base-change-local-property}).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The statement makes sense by Lemma \ref{lemma-finite-type-red}.
To see that it is true assume we have morphisms $B \to A$ and $B \to C$
in $\textit{WAdm}^{count}$ such that $B/\mathfrak b \to A/\mathfrak a$
is of finite type where $\mathfrak b \subset B$ and $\mathfrak a \subset A$
are the ideals of topologically nilpotent elements.
Since $A$ and $B$ are weakly admissible, the ideals
$\mathfrak a$ and $\mathfrak b$ are open.
Let $\mathfrak c \subset C$ be the (open) ideal
of topologically nilpotent elements. Then we find a surjection
$A \widehat{\otimes}_B C \to
A/\mathfrak a \otimes_{B/\mathfrak b} C/\mathfrak c$
whose kernel is a weak ideal of definition and hence consists
of topologically nilpotent elements
(please compare with the proof of Formal Algebraic Spaces,
Lemma \ref{formal-spaces-lemma-completed-tensor-product}). Since already
$C/\mathfrak c \to A/\mathfrak a \otimes_{B/\mathfrak b} C/\mathfrak c$
is of finite type as a base change of $B/\mathfrak b \to A/\mathfrak a$
we conclude.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-finite-type-red-morphisms}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of
locally countably indexed formal algebraic spaces over $S$.
The following are equivalent
\begin{enumerate}
\item for every commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
U \ar[d] \ar[r] & V \ar[d] \\
X \ar[r] & Y
}
$$
with $U$ and $V$ affine formal algebraic spaces, $U \to X$ and $V \to Y$
representable by algebraic spaces and \'etale, the morphism $U \to V$
corresponds to a morphism of $\textit{WAdm}^{count}$ satisfying the
property defined in Lemma \ref{lemma-finite-type-red},
\item there exists a covering $\{Y_j \to Y\}$ as in
Formal Algebraic Spaces,
Definition \ref{formal-spaces-definition-formal-algebraic-space}
and for each $j$
a covering $\{X_{ji} \to Y_j \times_Y X\}$ as in
Formal Algebraic Spaces,
Definition \ref{formal-spaces-definition-formal-algebraic-space}
such that each $X_{ji} \to Y_j$  corresponds
to a morphism of $\textit{WAdm}^{count}$ satisfying the
property defined in Lemma \ref{lemma-finite-type-red},
\item there exist a covering $\{X_i \to X\}$ as in
Formal Algebraic Spaces,
Definition \ref{formal-spaces-definition-formal-algebraic-space}
and for each $i$ a factorization $X_i \to Y_i \to Y$ where $Y_i$
is an affine formal algebraic space, $Y_i \to Y$ is representable
by algebraic spaces and \'etale, and $X_i \to Y_i$ corresponds
to a morphism of $\textit{WAdm}^{count}$ satisfying the
property defined in Lemma \ref{lemma-finite-type-red}, and
\item the morphism $f_{red} : X_{red} \to Y_{red}$ is locally of finite type.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Flat morphisms}
\label{section-flat}

\noindent
In this section we review what we know about flat morphisms
of locally Noetherian formal algebraic spaces.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-flat-axioms}
The property $P(\varphi)=$``$\varphi$ is flat'' on arrows
of $\textit{WAdm}^{Noeth}$ is a local property as defined in
Formal Spaces, Remark \ref{formal-spaces-remark-variant-Noetherian}.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let us recall what the statement signifies. First, 
$\textit{WAdm}^{Noeth}$ is the category whose objects are
adic Noetherian topological rings and whose morphisms are
continuous ring homomorphisms. Consider a commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
B \ar[r] & (B')^\wedge \\
A \ar[r] \ar[u]^\varphi & (A')^\wedge \ar[u]_{\varphi'}
}
$$
satisfying the following conditions:
$A$ and $B$ are adic Noetherian topological rings,
$A \to A'$ and $B \to B'$ are \'etale ring maps,
$(A')^\wedge = \lim A'/I^nA'$ for some ideal of definition $I \subset A$,
$(B')^\wedge = \lim B'/J^nB'$ for some ideal of definition $J \subset B$, and
$\varphi : A \to B$ and $\varphi' : (A')^\wedge \to (B')^\wedge$
are continuous. Note that $(A')^\wedge$ and $(B')^\wedge$ are
adic Noetherian topological rings by
Formal Spaces, Lemma \ref{formal-spaces-lemma-completion-in-sub}.
We have to show
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\varphi$ is flat $\Rightarrow \varphi'$ is flat,
\item if $B \to B'$ faithfully flat, then $\varphi'$ is flat
$\Rightarrow \varphi$ is flat, and
\item if $A \to B_i$ is flat for $i = 1, \ldots, n$, then
$A \to \prod_{i = 1, \ldots, n} B_i$ is flat.
\end{enumerate}
We will use without further mention that completions of Noetherian rings
are flat (Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-completion-flat}). Since
of course $A \to A'$ and $B \to B'$ are flat, we see in
particular that the horizontal arrows in the diagram are flat.

\medskip\noindent
Proof of (1). If $\varphi$ is flat, then the composition
$A \to (A')^\wedge \to (B')^\wedge$ is flat. Hence $A' \to (B')^\wedge$
is flat by More on Flatness, Lemma \ref{flat-lemma-etale-flat-up-down}.
Hence we see that $(A')^\wedge \to (B')^\wedge$ is flat by applying
More on Algebra, Lemma \ref{more-algebra-lemma-flat-after-completion}
with $R = A'$, with ideal $I(A')$, and with $M = (B')^\wedge = M^\wedge$.

\medskip\noindent
Proof of (2). Assume $\varphi'$ is flat and $B \to B'$ is faithfully flat.
Then the composition $A \to (A')^\wedge \to (B')^\wedge$ is flat.
Also we see that $B \to (B')^\wedge$ is faithfully flat by
Formal Algebraic Spaces, Lemma
\ref{formal-spaces-lemma-etale-surjective}.
Hence by Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-flatness-descends-more-general}
we find that $\varphi : A \to B$ is flat.

\medskip\noindent
Proof of (3). Omitted.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-base-change-flat-continuous}
Denote $P$ the property of arrows of $\textit{WAdm}^{Noeth}$
defined in Lemma \ref{lemma-flat-axioms}.
Denote $Q$ the property defined in Lemma \ref{lemma-finite-type-red}
viewed as a property of arrows of $\textit{WAdm}^{Noeth}$.
Then
\begin{enumerate}
\item $P$ is stable under base change by $Q$
(Formal Spaces, Remark
\ref{formal-spaces-remark-base-change-variant-variant-Noetherian}), and
\item $P + Q$ is stable under base change
(Formal Spaces, Remark
\ref{formal-spaces-remark-base-change-variant-Noetherian}).
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}

\end{proof}










\section{Rig-smooth homomorphisms}
\label{section-rig-smooth-homomorphisms}

\noindent
In this section we prove some properties of
rig-smooth homomorphisms of adic Noetherian
topological rings which are needed to introduce
rig-smooth morpisms of locally Noetherian
formal algebraic spaces.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-rig-smooth-continuous}
Let $A \to B$ be a morphism in $\textit{WAdm}^{Noeth}$
(Formal Spaces, Section \ref{formal-spaces-section-morphisms-rings}).
The following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] $A \to B$ satisfies the equivalent conditions of
Lemma \ref{lemma-finite-type} and there exists an ideal of definition
$I \subset B$ such that $B$ is rig-smooth over $(A, I)$, and
\item[(b)] $A \to B$ satisfies the equivalent conditions of
Lemma \ref{lemma-finite-type} and for all ideals of definition
$I \subset A$ the algebra $B$ is rig-smooth over $(A, I)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $I$ and $I'$ be ideals of definitions of $A$. Then there exists an
integer $c \geq 0$ such that $I^c \subset I'$ and $(I')^c \subset I$. Hence
$B$ is rig-smooth over $(A, I)$ if and only if
$B$ is rig-smooth over $(A, I')$. This follows from
Definition \ref{definition-rig-smooth-homomorphism},
the inclusions $I^c \subset I'$ and $(I')^c \subset I$, and
the fact that the naive cotangent complex $\NL_{B/A}^\wedge$
is independent of the choice of ideal of definition of $A$ by
Remark \ref{remark-NL-well-defined-topological}.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-rig-smooth-continuous-homomorphism}
Let $\varphi : A \to B$ be a continuous ring homomorphism
between adic Noetherian topological rings, i.e., $\varphi$
is an arrow of $\textit{WAdm}^{Noeth}$. We say
$\varphi$ is {\it rig-smooth} if the equivalent conditions
of Lemma \ref{lemma-rig-smooth-continuous} hold.
\end{definition}

\noindent
This defines a local property.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-rig-smooth-axioms}
The property $P(\varphi)=$``$\varphi$ is rig-smooth'' on arrows
of $\textit{WAdm}^{Noeth}$ is a local property as defined in
Formal Spaces, Remark \ref{formal-spaces-remark-variant-Noetherian}.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let us recall what the statement signifies. First, 
$\textit{WAdm}^{Noeth}$ is the category whose objects are
adic Noetherian topological rings and whose morphisms are
continuous ring homomorphisms. Consider a commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
B \ar[r] & (B')^\wedge \\
A \ar[r] \ar[u]^\varphi & (A')^\wedge \ar[u]_{\varphi'}
}
$$
satisfying the following conditions:
$A$ and $B$ are adic Noetherian topological rings,
$A \to A'$ and $B \to B'$ are \'etale ring maps,
$(A')^\wedge = \lim A'/I^nA'$ for some ideal of definition $I \subset A$,
$(B')^\wedge = \lim B'/J^nB'$ for some ideal of definition $J \subset B$, and
$\varphi : A \to B$ and $\varphi' : (A')^\wedge \to (B')^\wedge$
are continuous. Note that $(A')^\wedge$ and $(B')^\wedge$ are
adic Noetherian topological rings by
Formal Spaces, Lemma \ref{formal-spaces-lemma-completion-in-sub}.
We have to show
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\varphi$ is rig-smooth $\Rightarrow \varphi'$ is rig-smooth,
\item if $B \to B'$ faithfully flat, then $\varphi'$ is rig-smooth
$\Rightarrow \varphi$ is rig-smooth, and
\item if $A \to B_i$ is rig-smooth for $i = 1, \ldots, n$, then
$A \to \prod_{i = 1, \ldots, n} B_i$ is rig-smooth.
\end{enumerate}
The equivalent conditions of Lemma \ref{lemma-finite-type} satisfy
conditions (1), (2), and (3).
Thus in verifying (1), (2), and (3) for the property
``rig-smooth'' we may already assume our ring maps satisfy
the equivalent conditions of Lemma \ref{lemma-finite-type}
in each case.

\medskip\noindent
Pick an ideal of definition $I \subset A$. By the remarks above
the topology on each ring in the diagram is the $I$-adic topology
and $B$, $(A')^\wedge$, and $(B')^\wedge$ are in the category
(\ref{equation-C-prime}) for $(A, I)$.
Since $A \to A'$ and $B \to B'$ are \'etale the complexes
$\NL_{A'/A}$ and $\NL_{B'/B}$ are zero and hence
$\NL_{(A')^\wedge/A}^\wedge$ and $\NL_{(B')^\wedge/B}^\wedge$
are zero by Lemma \ref{lemma-NL-is-completion}.
Applying Lemma \ref{lemma-exact-sequence-NL} to
$A \to (A')^\wedge \to (B')^\wedge$ we get isomorphisms
$$
H^i(\NL_{(B')^\wedge/(A')^\wedge}^\wedge) \to H^i(\NL_{(B')^\wedge/A}^\wedge)
$$
Thus $\NL_{(B')^\wedge/A}^\wedge \to \NL_{(B')^\wedge/(A')^\wedge}$
is a quasi-isomorphism. The ring maps $B/I^nB \to B'/I^nB'$ are \'etale
and hence are local complete intersections
(Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-etale-standard-smooth}).
Hence we may apply
Lemmas \ref{lemma-exact-sequence-NL} and
\ref{lemma-transitive-lci-at-end} to
$A \to B \to (B')^\wedge$ and we get isomorphisms
$$
H^i(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge \otimes_B (B')^\wedge) \to
H^i(\NL_{(B')^\wedge/A}^\wedge)
$$
We conclude that
$\NL_{B/A}^\wedge \otimes_B (B')^\wedge \to \NL_{(B')^\wedge/A}^\wedge$
is a quasi-isomorphism. Combining these two observations we obtain that
$$
\NL_{(B')^\wedge/(A')^\wedge}^\wedge \cong
\NL_{B/A}^\wedge \otimes_B (B')^\wedge
$$
in $D((B')^\wedge)$.
With these preparations out of the way we can start the actual proof.

\medskip\noindent
Proof of (1). Assume $\varphi$ is rig-smooth. Then there exists a $c \geq 0$
such that $\Ext^1_B(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge, N)$ is annihilated by $I^c$
for every $B$-module $N$. By
More on Algebra, Lemmas \ref{more-algebra-lemma-two-term-base-change} and
\ref{more-algebra-lemma-base-change-property-ext-1-annihilated}
this property is preserved under base change by $B \to (B')^\wedge$.
Hence $\Ext^1_{(B')^\wedge}(\NL_{(B')^\wedge/(A')^\wedge}^\wedge, N)$
is annihilated by $I^c(A')^\wedge$ for all $(B')^\wedge$-modules $N$
which tells us that $\varphi'$ is rig-smooth.
This proves (1).

\medskip\noindent
To prove (2) assume $B \to B'$ is faithfully flat and that $\varphi'$
is rig-smooth. Then there exists a $c \geq 0$ such that
$\Ext^1_{(B')^\wedge}(\NL_{(B')^\wedge/(A')^\wedge}^\wedge, N')$
is annihilated by $I^c(B')^\wedge$ for every $(B')^\wedge$-module $N'$.
The composition $B \to B' \to (B')^\wedge$ is flat
(Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-completion-flat})
hence for any $B$-module $N$ we have
$$
\Ext^1_B(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge, N) \otimes_B (B')^\wedge =
\Ext^1_{(B')^\wedge}(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge \otimes_B (B')^\wedge,
N \otimes_B (B')^\wedge)
$$
by More on Algebra, Lemma \ref{more-algebra-lemma-base-change-RHom} part (3)
(minor details omitted). Thus we see that this module is annihilated
by $I^c$. However, $B \to (B')^\wedge$ is actually faithfully flat
by our assumption that $B \to B'$ is faithfully flat (Formal Spaces, Lemma
\ref{formal-spaces-lemma-etale-surjective}). Thus we conclude that
$\Ext^1_B(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge, N)$ is annihilated by $I^c$.
Hence $\varphi$ is rig-smooth. This proves (2).

\medskip\noindent
To prove (3), setting $B = \prod_{i = 1, \ldots, n} B_i$
we just observe that $\NL_{B/A}^\wedge$ is the direct
sum of the complexes $\NL_{B_i/A}^\wedge$ viewed as complexes
of $B$-modules.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-base-change-rig-smooth-continuous}
Consider the properties $P(\varphi)=$``$\varphi$ is rig-smooth''
and $Q(\varphi)$=``$\varphi$ is adic'' on arrows of $\textit{WAdm}^{Noeth}$.
Then $P$ is stable under base change by $Q$ as defined in
Formal Spaces, Remark
\ref{formal-spaces-remark-base-change-variant-variant-Noetherian}.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The statement makes sense by Lemma \ref{lemma-rig-smooth-continuous}.
To see that it is true assume we have morphisms
$B \to A$ and $B \to C$ in $\textit{WAdm}^{Noeth}$
and that $B \to A$ is rig-smooth and $B \to C$ is adic
(Formal Algebraic Spaces, Definition
\ref{formal-spaces-definition-adic-homomorphism}).
Then we can choose an ideal of definition $I \subset B$
such that the topology on $A$ and $C$ is the $I$-adic topology.
In this situation it follows immediately that
$A \widehat{\otimes}_B C$ is rig-smooth over $(C, IC)$ by
Lemma \ref{lemma-base-change-rig-smooth-homomorphism}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-composition-rig-smooth-continuous}
The property $P(\varphi)=$``$\varphi$ is rig-smooth''
on arrows of $\textit{WAdm}^{Noeth}$ is stable under composition
as defined in Formal Spaces, Remark
\ref{formal-spaces-remark-composition-variant-Noetherian}.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We strongly urge the reader to find their own proof and not read the proof
that follows. The statement makes sense by
Lemma \ref{lemma-rig-smooth-continuous}.
To see that it is true assume we have rig-smooth morphisms
$A \to B$ and $B \to C$ in $\textit{WAdm}^{Noeth}$.
Then we can choose an ideal of definition $I \subset A$
such that the topology on $C$ and $B$ is the $I$-adic topology.
By Lemma \ref{lemma-exact-sequence-NL} we obtain an exact sequence
$$
\xymatrix{
C \otimes_B H^0(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge) \ar[r] &
H^0(\NL_{C/A}^\wedge) \ar[r] &
H^0(\NL_{C/B}^\wedge) \ar[r] & 0 \\
H^{-1}(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge \otimes_B C) \ar[r] &
H^{-1}(\NL_{C/A}^\wedge) \ar[r] &
H^{-1}(\NL_{C/B}^\wedge) \ar[llu]
}
$$
Observe that $H^{-1}(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge \otimes_B C)$
and $H^{-1}(\NL_{C/B}^\wedge)$ are annihilated by
a power of $I$; this follows from
Lemma \ref{lemma-equivalent-with-artin-smooth} part (2)
combined with
More on Algebra, Lemmas \ref{more-algebra-lemma-two-term-base-change} and
\ref{more-algebra-lemma-base-change-property-ext-1-annihilated}
(to deal with the base change by $B \to C$).
Hence $H^{-1}(\NL_{C/A}^\wedge)$ is annihilated by a power of $I$.
Next, by the characterization of rig-smooth algebras in
Lemma \ref{lemma-equivalent-with-artin-smooth} part (2)
which in turn refers to
More on Algebra, Lemma \ref{more-algebra-lemma-ext-1-annihilated} part (5)
we can choose $f_1, \ldots, f_s \in IB$ and $g_1, \ldots, g_t \in IC$
such that $V(f_1, \ldots, f_s) = V(IB)$ and
$V(g_1, \ldots, g_t) = V(IC)$ and such that
$H^0(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge)_{f_i}$ is a finite projective $B_{f_i}$-module and
$H^0(\NL_{C/B}^\wedge)_{g_j}$ is a finite projective $C_{g_j}$-module.
Since the cohomologies in degree $-1$ vanish upon localization at
$f_ig_j$ we get a short exact sequence
$$
0 \to
(C \otimes_B H^0(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge))_{f_ig_j} \to
H^0(\NL_{C/A}^\wedge)_{f_ig_j} \to
H^0(\NL_{C/B}^\wedge)_{f_ig_j} \to 0
$$
and we conclude that $H^0(\NL_{C/A}^\wedge)_{f_ig_j}$ is a finite
projective $C_{f_ig_j}$-module as an extension of same.
Thus by the criterion in
Lemma \ref{lemma-equivalent-with-artin-smooth} part (2)
and via that the criterion in
More on Algebra, Lemma \ref{more-algebra-lemma-ext-1-annihilated} part (4)
we conclude that $C$ is rig-smooth over $(A, I)$.
\end{proof}








\section{Rig-smooth morphisms}
\label{section-rig-smooth-morphisms}

\noindent
In this section we use the work done in
Section \ref{section-rig-smooth-homomorphisms}
to define rig-smooth morphisms of locally Noetherian algebraic spaces.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-rig-smooth}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of locally
Noetherian formal algebraic spaces over $S$. We say $f$ is
{\it rig-smooth} if for every commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
U \ar[d] \ar[r] & V \ar[d] \\
X \ar[r] & Y
}
$$
with $U$ and $V$ affine formal algebraic spaces, $U \to X$ and $V \to Y$
representable by algebraic spaces and \'etale, the morphism $U \to V$
corresponds to a rig-smooth map of adic Noetherian topological rings.
\end{definition}

\noindent
Let us prove that we can check this condition \'etale locally on
source and target.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-rig-smooth-morphisms}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of
locally Noetherian formal algebraic spaces over $S$.
The following are equivalent
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ is rig-smooth,
\item for every commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
U \ar[d] \ar[r] & V \ar[d] \\
X \ar[r] & Y
}
$$
with $U$ and $V$ affine formal algebraic spaces, $U \to X$ and $V \to Y$
representable by algebraic spaces and \'etale, the morphism $U \to V$
corresponds to a rig-smooth map in $\textit{WAdm}^{count}$,
\item there exists a covering $\{Y_j \to Y\}$ as in
Formal Algebraic Spaces,
Definition \ref{formal-spaces-definition-formal-algebraic-space}
and for each $j$
a covering $\{X_{ji} \to Y_j \times_Y X\}$ as in
Formal Algebraic Spaces,
Definition \ref{formal-spaces-definition-formal-algebraic-space}
such that each $X_{ji} \to Y_j$  corresponds
to a rig-smooth map in $\textit{WAdm}^{count}$, and
\item there exist a covering $\{X_i \to X\}$ as in
Formal Algebraic Spaces,
Definition \ref{formal-spaces-definition-formal-algebraic-space}
and for each $i$ a factorization $X_i \to Y_i \to Y$ where $Y_i$
is an affine formal algebraic space, $Y_i \to Y$ is representable
by algebraic spaces and \'etale, and $X_i \to Y_i$ corresponds
to a rig-smooth map in $\textit{WAdm}^{count}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The equivalence of (1) and (2) is Definition \ref{definition-rig-smooth}.
The equivalence of (2), (3), and (4) follows from the fact that
being rig-smooth is a local property of arrows of
$\text{WAdm}^{Noeth}$ by Lemma \ref{lemma-rig-smooth-axioms}
and an application of the variant of
Formal Algebraic Spaces, Lemma
\ref{formal-spaces-lemma-property-defines-property-morphisms}
for morphisms between locally Noetherian algebraic spaces
mentioned in
Formal Algebraic Spaces, Remark
\ref{formal-spaces-remark-variant-Noetherian}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-base-change-rig-smooth}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $f : X \to Y$ and $g : Z \to Y$
be morphisms of locally Noetherian formal algebraic spaces over $S$.
If $f$ is rig-smooth and $g$ is adic, then the base change
$X \times_Y Z \to Z$ is rig-smooth.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By Formal Algebraic Spaces, Remark
\ref{formal-spaces-remark-base-change-variant-variant-Noetherian}
and the discussion in Formal Algebraic Spaces, Section
\ref{formal-spaces-section-adic},
this follows from Lemma \ref{lemma-base-change-rig-smooth-continuous}.

Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $f : X \to Y$ and $g : Y \to Z$
be morphisms of locally Noetherian formal algebraic spaces over $S$.
If $f$ and $g$ are rig-smooth, then so is $g \circ f$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By Formal Algebraic Spaces, Remark

this follows from Lemma \ref{lemma-composition-rig-smooth-continuous}.

\section{Rig-\'etale homomorphisms}
\label{section-rig-etale-homomorphisms}

\noindent
In this section we prove some properties of rig-\'etale homomorphisms
of adic Noetherian topological rings which are needed to introduce
rig-\'etale morphisms of locally Noetherian algebraic spaces.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-rig-etale-continuous}
Let $A \to B$ be a morphism in $\textit{WAdm}^{Noeth}$
(Formal Spaces, Section \ref{formal-spaces-section-morphisms-rings}).
The following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] $A \to B$ satisfies the equivalent conditions of
Lemma \ref{lemma-finite-type} and there exists an ideal of definition
$I \subset B$ such that $B$ is rig-\'etale over $(A, I)$, and
\item[(b)] $A \to B$ satisfies the equivalent conditions of
Lemma \ref{lemma-finite-type} and for all ideals of definition
$I \subset A$ the algebra $B$ is rig-\'etale over $(A, I)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $I$ and $I'$ be ideals of definitions of $A$. Then there exists an
integer $c \geq 0$ such that $I^c \subset I'$ and $(I')^c \subset I$. Hence
$B$ is rig-\'etale over $(A, I)$ if and only if
$B$ is rig-\'etale over $(A, I')$. This follows from
Definition \ref{definition-rig-etale-homomorphism},
the inclusions $I^c \subset I'$ and $(I')^c \subset I$, and
the fact that the naive cotangent complex $\NL_{B/A}^\wedge$
is independent of the choice of ideal of definition of $A$ by
Remark \ref{remark-NL-well-defined-topological}.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-rig-etale-continuous-homomorphism}
Let $\varphi : A \to B$ be a continuous ring homomorphism
between adic Noetherian topological rings, i.e., $\varphi$
is an arrow of $\textit{WAdm}^{Noeth}$. We say
$\varphi$ is {\it rig-etale} if the equivalent conditions
of Lemma \ref{lemma-rig-etale-continuous} hold.
\end{definition}

\noindent
This defines a local property.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-rig-etale-axioms}
The property $P(\varphi)=$``$\varphi$ is rig-\'etale'' on arrows
of $\textit{WAdm}^{Noeth}$ is a local property as defined in
Formal Spaces, Remark \ref{formal-spaces-remark-variant-Noetherian}.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
This proof is exactly the same as the proof of
Lemma \ref{lemma-rig-smooth-axioms}.
Let us recall what the statement signifies. First, 
$\textit{WAdm}^{Noeth}$ is the category whose objects are
adic Noetherian topological rings and whose morphisms are
continuous ring homomorphisms. Consider a commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
B \ar[r] & (B')^\wedge \\
A \ar[r] \ar[u]^\varphi & (A')^\wedge \ar[u]_{\varphi'}
}
$$
satisfying the following conditions:
$A$ and $B$ are adic Noetherian topological rings,
$A \to A'$ and $B \to B'$ are \'etale ring maps,
$(A')^\wedge = \lim A'/I^nA'$ for some ideal of definition $I \subset A$,
$(B')^\wedge = \lim B'/J^nB'$ for some ideal of definition $J \subset B$, and
$\varphi : A \to B$ and $\varphi' : (A')^\wedge \to (B')^\wedge$
are continuous. Note that $(A')^\wedge$ and $(B')^\wedge$ are
adic Noetherian topological rings by
Formal Spaces, Lemma \ref{formal-spaces-lemma-completion-in-sub}.
We have to show
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\varphi$ is rig-\'etale $\Rightarrow \varphi'$ is rig-\'etale,
\item if $B \to B'$ faithfully flat, then $\varphi'$ is rig-\'etale
$\Rightarrow \varphi$ is rig-\'etale, and
\item if $A \to B_i$ is rig-\'etale for $i = 1, \ldots, n$, then
$A \to \prod_{i = 1, \ldots, n} B_i$ is rig-\'etale.
\end{enumerate}
The equivalent conditions of Lemma \ref{lemma-finite-type} satisfy
conditions (1), (2), and (3).
Thus in verifying (1), (2), and (3) for the property
``rig-\'etale'' we may already assume our ring maps satisfy
the equivalent conditions of Lemma \ref{lemma-finite-type}
in each case.

\medskip\noindent
Pick an ideal of definition $I \subset A$. By the remarks above
the topology on each ring in the diagram is the $I$-adic topology
and $B$, $(A')^\wedge$, and $(B')^\wedge$ are in the category
(\ref{equation-C-prime}) for $(A, I)$.
Since $A \to A'$ and $B \to B'$ are \'etale the complexes
$\NL_{A'/A}$ and $\NL_{B'/B}$ are zero and hence
$\NL_{(A')^\wedge/A}^\wedge$ and $\NL_{(B')^\wedge/B}^\wedge$
are zero by Lemma \ref{lemma-NL-is-completion}.
Applying Lemma \ref{lemma-exact-sequence-NL} to
$A \to (A')^\wedge \to (B')^\wedge$ we get isomorphisms
$$
H^i(\NL_{(B')^\wedge/(A')^\wedge}^\wedge) \to H^i(\NL_{(B')^\wedge/A}^\wedge)
$$
Thus $\NL_{(B')^\wedge/A}^\wedge \to \NL_{(B')^\wedge/(A')^\wedge}$
is a quasi-isomorphism. The ring maps $B/I^nB \to B'/I^nB'$ are \'etale
and hence are local complete intersections
(Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-etale-standard-smooth}).
Hence we may apply
Lemmas \ref{lemma-exact-sequence-NL} and
\ref{lemma-transitive-lci-at-end} to
$A \to B \to (B')^\wedge$ and we get isomorphisms
$$
H^i(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge \otimes_B (B')^\wedge) \to
H^i(\NL_{(B')^\wedge/A}^\wedge)
$$
We conclude that
$\NL_{B/A}^\wedge \otimes_B (B')^\wedge \to \NL_{(B')^\wedge/A}^\wedge$
is a quasi-isomorphism. Combining these two observations we obtain that
$$
\NL_{(B')^\wedge/(A')^\wedge}^\wedge \cong
\NL_{B/A}^\wedge \otimes_B (B')^\wedge
$$
in $D((B')^\wedge)$.
With these preparations out of the way we can start the actual proof.

\medskip\noindent
Proof of (1). Assume $\varphi$ is rig-\'etale. Then there exists a $c \geq 0$
such that multiplication by $a \in I^c$ is zero on $\NL_{B/A}^\wedge$
in $D(B)$. This property is preserved under base change
by $B \to (B')^\wedge$, see
More on Algebra, Lemmas \ref{more-algebra-lemma-two-term-base-change}.
By the isomorphism above we find that $\varphi'$ is rig-\'etale.
This proves (1).

\medskip\noindent
To prove (2) assume $B \to B'$ is faithfully flat and that $\varphi'$
is rig-\'etale. Then there exists a $c \geq 0$ such that
multiplication by $a \in I^c$ is zero on
$\NL_{(B')^\wedge/(A')^\wedge}^\wedge$ in $D((B')^\wedge)$.
By the isomorphism above we see that $a^c$ annihilates the
cohomology modules of
$\NL_{B/A}^\wedge \otimes_B (B')^\wedge$.
The composition $B \to (B')^\wedge$ is faithfully flat
by our assumption that $B \to B'$ is faithfully flat, see
Formal Spaces, Lemma \ref{formal-spaces-lemma-etale-surjective}.
Hence the cohomology modules of $\NL_{B/A}^\wedge$ are annihilated
by $I^c$. It follows from Lemma \ref{lemma-equivalent-with-artin}
that $\varphi$ is rig-\'etale.
This proves (2).

\medskip\noindent
To prove (3), setting $B = \prod_{i = 1, \ldots, n} B_i$
we just observe that $\NL_{B/A}^\wedge$ is the direct
sum of the complexes $\NL_{B_i/A}^\wedge$ viewed as complexes
of $B$-modules.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-base-change-rig-etale-continuous}
Consider the properties $P(\varphi)=$``$\varphi$ is rig-\'etale''
and $Q(\varphi)$=``$\varphi$ is adic'' on arrows of $\textit{WAdm}^{Noeth}$.
Then $P$ is stable under base change by $Q$ as defined in
Formal Spaces, Remark
\ref{formal-spaces-remark-base-change-variant-variant-Noetherian}.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The statement makes sense by Lemma \ref{lemma-rig-etale-continuous}.
To see that it is true assume we have morphisms
$B \to A$ and $B \to C$ in $\textit{WAdm}^{Noeth}$
and that $B \to A$ is rig-\'etale and $B \to C$ is adic
(Formal Algebraic Spaces, Definition
\ref{formal-spaces-definition-adic-homomorphism}).
Then we can choose an ideal of definition $I \subset B$
such that the topology on $A$ and $C$ is the $I$-adic topology.
In this situation it follows immediately that
$A \widehat{\otimes}_B C$ is rig-\'etale over $(C, IC)$ by
Lemma \ref{lemma-base-change-rig-etale-homomorphism}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-composition-rig-etale-continuous}
The property $P(\varphi)=$``$\varphi$ is rig-\'etale''
on arrows of $\textit{WAdm}^{Noeth}$ is stable under composition
as defined in Formal Spaces, Remark
\ref{formal-spaces-remark-composition-variant-Noetherian}.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The statement makes sense by
Lemma \ref{lemma-rig-etale-continuous}.
To see that it is true assume we have rig-\'etale morphisms
$A \to B$ and $B \to C$ in $\textit{WAdm}^{Noeth}$.
Then we can choose an ideal of definition $I \subset A$
such that the topology on $C$ and $B$ is the $I$-adic topology.
By Lemma \ref{lemma-exact-sequence-NL} we obtain an exact sequence
$$
\xymatrix{
C \otimes_B H^0(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge) \ar[r] &
H^0(\NL_{C/A}^\wedge) \ar[r] &
H^0(\NL_{C/B}^\wedge) \ar[r] & 0 \\
H^{-1}(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge \otimes_B C) \ar[r] &
H^{-1}(\NL_{C/A}^\wedge) \ar[r] &
H^{-1}(\NL_{C/B}^\wedge) \ar[llu]
}
$$
There exists a $c \geq 0$ such that for all $a \in I$ 
multiplication by $a^c$ is zero on $\NL_{B/A}^\wedge$ in $D(B)$ and
$\NL_{C/B}^\wedge$ in $D(C)$. Then of course
multiplication by $a^c$ is zero on $\NL_{B/A}^\wedge \otimes_B C$
in $D(C)$ too. Hence
$H^0(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge) \otimes_A C$, 
$H^0(\NL_{C/B}^\wedge)$, 
$H^{-1}(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge \otimes_B C)$, and
$H^{-1}(\NL_{C/B}^\wedge)$
are annihilated by $a^c$. From the exact sequence
we obtain that multiplication by $a^{2c}$ is zero on
$H^0(\NL_{C/A}^\wedge)$ and $H^{-1}(\NL_{C/A}^\wedge)$.
It follows from Lemma \ref{lemma-equivalent-with-artin}
that $C$ is rig-\'etale over $(A, I)$ as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-permanence-rig-etale-continuous}
The property $P(\varphi)=$``$\varphi$ is rig-\'etale''
on arrows of $\textit{WAdm}^{Noeth}$ has the cancellation property
as defined in Formal Spaces, Remark
\ref{formal-spaces-remark-permanence-variant-Noetherian}.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The statement makes sense by
Lemma \ref{lemma-rig-etale-continuous}.
To see that it is true assume we have maps
$A \to B$ and $B \to C$ in $\textit{WAdm}^{Noeth}$
with $A \to C$ and $A \to B$ rig-\'etale.
We have to show that $B \to C$ is rig-\'etale.
Then we can choose an ideal of definition $I \subset A$
such that the topology on $C$ and $B$ is the $I$-adic topology.
By Lemma \ref{lemma-exact-sequence-NL} we obtain an exact sequence
$$
\xymatrix{
C \otimes_B H^0(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge) \ar[r] &
H^0(\NL_{C/A}^\wedge) \ar[r] &
H^0(\NL_{C/B}^\wedge) \ar[r] & 0 \\
H^{-1}(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge \otimes_B C) \ar[r] &
H^{-1}(\NL_{C/A}^\wedge) \ar[r] &
H^{-1}(\NL_{C/B}^\wedge) \ar[llu]
}
$$
There exists a $c \geq 0$ such that for all $a \in I$ 
multiplication by $a^c$ is zero on $\NL_{B/A}^\wedge$ in $D(B)$ and
$\NL_{C/A}^\wedge$ in $D(C)$. Hence
$H^0(\NL_{B/A}^\wedge) \otimes_A C$,
$H^0(\NL_{C/A}^\wedge)$, and
$H^{-1}(\NL_{C/A}^\wedge)$
are annihilated by $a^c$. From the exact sequence
we obtain that multiplication by $a^{2c}$ is zero on
$H^0(\NL_{C/B}^\wedge)$ and $H^{-1}(\NL_{C/B}^\wedge)$.
It follows from Lemma \ref{lemma-equivalent-with-artin}
that $C$ is rig-\'etale over $(B, IB)$ as desired.

\label{section-rig-etale-morphisms}

In this section we use the work done in

\label{definition-rig-etale}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of locally

with $U$ and $V$ affine formal algebraic spaces, $U \to X$ and $V \to Y$
representable by algebraic spaces and \'etale, the morphism $U \to V$
corresponds to a rig-\'etale map of adic Noetherian topological rings.
\end{definition}

Let us prove that we can check this condition \'etale locally on
source and target.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-rig-\'etale-morphisms}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of

The following are equivalent
\begin{enumerate}

to a rig-\'etale map in $\textit{WAdm}^{count}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The equivalence of (1) and (2) is Definition \ref{definition-rig-etale}.
The equivalence of (2), (3), and (4) follows from the fact that
being rig-\'etale is a local property of arrows of
$\text{WAdm}^{Noeth}$ by Lemma \ref{lemma-rig-etale-axioms}
and an application of the variant of
Formal Algebraic Spaces, Lemma
\ref{formal-spaces-lemma-property-defines-property-morphisms}
for morphisms between locally Noetherian algebraic spaces
mentioned in Formal Algebraic Spaces, Remark
\ref{formal-spaces-remark-variant-Noetherian}.
\end{proof}

\noindent
To be sure, a rig-\'etale morphism is locally of finite type.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-rig-etale-finite-type}
A rig-\'etale morphism of locally Noetherian formal algebraic spaces
is locally of finite type.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The property $P$ in Lemma \ref{lemma-rig-etale-axioms}
implies the equivalent conditions (a), (b), (c), and (d) in
Formal Spaces, Lemma
\ref{formal-spaces-lemma-quotient-restricted-power-series}.
Hence this follows from
Formal Spaces, Lemma \ref{formal-spaces-lemma-finite-type-local-property}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-rig-etale-rig-smooth-morphism}
A rig-\'etale morphism of locally Noetherian formal algebraic spaces
is rig-smooth.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Follows from the definitions and
Lemma \ref{lemma-rig-etale-rig-smooth}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-base-change-rig-etale}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $f : X \to Y$ and $g : Z \to Y$
be morphisms of locally Noetherian formal algebraic spaces over $S$.
If $f$ is rig-\'etale and $g$ is adic, then the base change
$X \times_Y Z \to Z$ is rig-\'etale.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By Formal Algebraic Spaces, Remark
\ref{formal-spaces-remark-base-change-variant-variant-Noetherian}
and the discussion in Formal Algebraic Spaces, Section
\ref{formal-spaces-section-adic},
this follows from Lemma \ref{lemma-base-change-rig-etale-continuous}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-composition-rig-etale}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $f : X \to Y$ and $g : Y \to Z$
be morphisms of locally Noetherian formal algebraic spaces over $S$.
If $f$ and $g$ are rig-\'etale, then so is $g \circ f$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By Formal Algebraic Spaces, Remark
\ref{formal-spaces-remark-composition-variant-Noetherian}
this follows from Lemma \ref{lemma-composition-rig-etale-continuous}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-rig-etale-permanence}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $f : X \to Y$ and $g : Y \to Z$
be a morphism of locally Noetherian formal algebraic spaces over $S$.
If $g \circ f$ and $g$ are rig-\'etale, then so is $f$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By Formal Algebraic Spaces, Remark
\ref{formal-spaces-remark-permanence-variant-Noetherian}
this follows from Lemma \ref{lemma-permanence-rig-etale-continuous}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-closed-immersion-rig-smooth}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of formal algebraic
spaces. Assume that $X$ and $Y$ are locally Noetherian and $f$ is a
closed immersion. The following are equivalent
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ is rig-smooth,
\item $f$ is rig-\'etale,
\item for every affine formal algebraic space $V$ and every morphism
$V \to Y$ which is representable by algebraic spaces and \'etale
the morphism $X \times_Y V \to V$ corresponds to a surjective morphism
$B \to A$ in $\textit{WAdm}^{Noeth}$ whose kernel $J$ has the following
property: $I(J/J^2) = 0$ for some ideal of definition $I$ of $B$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let us observe that given $V$ and $V \to Y$ as in (2) without any
further assumption on $f$ we see that the morphism $X \times_Y V \to V$
corresponds to a surjective morphism $B \to A$ in $\textit{WAdm}^{Noeth}$
by Formal Algebraic Spaces, Lemma
\ref{formal-spaces-lemma-closed-immersion-into-countably-indexed}.

\medskip\noindent
We have (2) $\Rightarrow$ (1) by
Lemma \ref{lemma-rig-etale-rig-smooth-morphism}.

\medskip\noindent
Proof of (3) $\Rightarrow$ (2). Assume (3). By
Lemma \ref{lemma-rig-\'etale-morphisms}
it suffices to show that the ring maps
$B \to A$ occuring in (3) are rig-\'etale in the
sense of Definition \ref{definition-rig-etale-continuous-homomorphism}.
Let $I$ be as in (3). The naive cotangent complex
$\NL_{A/B}^\wedge$ of $A$ over $(B, I)$ is the complex of $A$-modules
given by putting $J/J^2$ in degree $-1$. Hence $A$ is
rig-\'etale over $(B, I)$ by
Definition \ref{definition-rig-etale-homomorphism}.

\medskip\noindent
Assume (1) and let $V$ and $B \to A$ be as in (3).
By Definition \ref{definition-rig-smooth} we see that
$B \to A$ is rig-smooth. Choose any ideal of definition $I \subset B$.
Then $A$ is rig-smooth over $(B, I)$.
As above the complex $\NL_{A/B}^\wedge$ is 
given by putting $J/J^2$ in degree $-1$.
Hence by Lemma \ref{lemma-equivalent-with-artin-smooth}
we see that $J/J^2$ is annihilated by
a power $I^n$ for some $n \geq 1$. Since $B$ is adic, we see
that $I^n$ is an ideal of definition of $B$ and the
proof is complete.
\end{proof}














\section{Rig-surjective morphisms}
\label{section-rig-surjective}

\noindent
For morphisms locally of finite type between locally Noetherian formal
algebraic spaces a definition borrowed from \cite{ArtinII} can be used. See
Remark \ref{remark-rig-surjective-more-general} for a discussion
of what to do in more general cases.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-rig-surjective}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of formal
algebraic spaces over $S$. Assume that $X$ and $Y$ are locally
Noetherian and that $f$ is locally of finite type. We say
$f$ is {\it rig-surjective} if for every solid diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
\text{Spf}(R') \ar@{..>}[r] \ar@{..>}[d] & X \ar[d]^f \\
\text{Spf}(R) \ar[r]^-p & Y
}
$$
where $R$ is a complete discrete valuation ring and where
$p$ is an adic morphism there exists an
extension of complete discrete valuation rings $R \subset R'$
and a morphism $\text{Spf}(R') \to X$ making the displayed diagram commute.
\end{definition}

\noindent
We will see in the lemmas below that this notion behaves reasonably well
in the context of locally Noetherian formal algebraic spaces and morphisms
which are locally of finite type.
In the next remark we discuss options for modifying this definition
to a wider class of morphisms of formal algebraic spaces.

\begin{remark}
\label{remark-rig-surjective-more-general}
The condition as formulated in Definition \ref{definition-rig-surjective}
is not right even for morphisms of finite type
of locally adic* formal algebraic spaces.
For example, if $A = (\bigcup_{n \geq 1} k[t^{1/n}])^\wedge$
where the completion is the $t$-adic completion, then
there are no adic morphisms $\text{Spf}(R) \to \text{Spf}(A)$
where $R$ is a complete discrete valuation ring.
Thus any morphism $X \to \text{Spf}(A)$ would be rig-surjective,
but since $A$ is a domain and $t \in A$ is not zero, we want to
think of $A$ as having at least one ``rig-point'', and we do not
want to allow $X = \emptyset$. To cover this
particular case, one can consider adic morphisms
$$
\text{Spf}(R) \longrightarrow Y
$$
where $R$ is a valuation ring complete with respect to a principal
ideal $J$ whose radical is $\mathfrak m_R = \sqrt{J}$.
In this case the value group of $R$ can be embedded into
$(\mathbf{R}, +)$ and one obtains the point of view used by
Berkovich in defining an analytic space associated to $Y$, see
\cite{Berkovich}. Another approach is championed by Huber. In his theory,
one drops the hypothesis that $\Spec(R/J)$ is a singleton, see
\cite{Huber-continuous-valuations}.
\end{remark}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-composition-rig-surjective}
\begin{slogan}
Rig-surjectivity of locally finite type morphisms is preserved under
composition
\end{slogan}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $f : X \to Y$ and $g : Y \to Z$ be morphisms of formal
algebraic spaces over $S$. Assume $X$, $Y$, $Z$ are locally Noetherian and
$f$ and $g$ locally of finite type. Then if $f$ and $g$ are rig-surjective,
so is $g \circ f$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Follows in a straightforward manner from the definitions
(and Formal Spaces, Lemma \ref{formal-spaces-lemma-composition-finite-type}).
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-base-change-rig-surjective}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $f : X \to Y$ and $Z \to Y$ be morphisms
of formal algebraic spaces over $S$. Assume $X$, $Y$, $Z$ are locally
Noetherian and $f$ and $g$ locally of finite type. If $f$ is
rig-surjective, then the base change $Z \times_Y X \to Z$ is too.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Follows in a straightforward manner from the definitions (and
Formal Spaces, Lemmas \ref{formal-spaces-lemma-fibre-product-Noetherian} and
\ref{formal-spaces-lemma-base-change-finite-type}).
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-permanence-rig-surjective}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $f : X \to Y$ and $g : Y \to Z$ be morphisms of
formal algebraic spaces over $S$. Assume $X$, $Y$, $Z$ locally Noetherian
and $f$ and $g$ locally of finite type. If $g \circ f : X \to Z$
is rig-surjective, so is $g : Y \to Z$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Immediate from the definition.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-etale-covering-rig-surjective}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of locally Noetherian
formal algebraic spaces which is representable by algebraic spaces, \'etale,
and surjective. Then $f$ is rig-surjective.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $p : \text{Spf}(R) \to Y$ be an adic morphism where $R$ is a complete
discrete valuation ring. Let $Z = \text{Spf}(R) \times_Y X$. Then
$Z \to \text{Spf}(R)$ is representable by algebraic spaces, \'etale, and
surjective. Hence $Z$ is nonempty. Pick a nonempty affine formal algebraic
space $V$ and an \'etale morphism $V \to Z$ (possible by our definitions).
Then $V \to \text{Spf}(R)$ corresponds to $R \to A^\wedge$ where
$R \to A$ is an \'etale ring map, see Formal Spaces, Lemma
\ref{formal-spaces-lemma-etale}. Since $A^\wedge \not = 0$
(as $V \not = \emptyset$) we can find a maximal ideal $\mathfrak m$
of $A$ lying over $\mathfrak m_R$. Then $A_\mathfrak m$ is a discrete
valuation ring (More on Algebra, Lemma
\ref{more-algebra-lemma-Dedekind-etale-extension}).
Then $R' = A_\mathfrak m^\wedge$ is a complete discrete valuation ring
(More on Algebra, Lemma \ref{more-algebra-lemma-completion-dvr}).
Applying Formal Spaces, Lemma
\ref{formal-spaces-lemma-morphism-between-formal-spectra}.
we find the desired morphism $\text{Spf}(R') \to V \to Z \to X$.
\end{proof}

\noindent
The upshot of the lemmas above is that we may check whether
$f : X \to Y$ is rig-surjective, \'etale locally on $Y$.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-upshot}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of locally
Noetherian formal algebraic spaces which is locally of finite type.
Let $\{Y_i \to Y\}$ be a covering as in
Formal Spaces, Definition
\ref{formal-spaces-definition-formal-algebraic-space}.
Then $f$ is rig-surjective if and only if
each $f_i : X \times_Y Y_i \to Y_i$ is
rig-surjective.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Namely, if $f$ is rig-surjective, so is any base change
(Lemma \ref{lemma-base-change-rig-surjective}).
Conversely, if all $f_i$ are rig-surjective, so is
$\coprod f_i : \coprod X \times_Y Y_i \to \coprod Y_i$.
By Lemma \ref{lemma-etale-covering-rig-surjective}
the morphism $\coprod Y_i \to Y$ is rig-surjective.
Hence $\coprod X \times_Y Y_i \to Y$ is rig-surjective
(Lemma \ref{lemma-composition-rig-surjective}).
Since this morphism factors through $X \to Y$ we see that $X \to Y$
is rig-surjective by Lemma \ref{lemma-permanence-rig-surjective}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-completion-proper-surjective-rig-surjective}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $f : X \to Y$ be a proper surjective morphism
of locally Noetherian algebraic spaces over $S$. Let $T \subset |Y|$
be a closed subset and let $T' = |f|^{-1}(T) \subset |X|$.
Then $X_{/T'} \to Y_{/T}$ is rig-surjective.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The statement makes sense by
Formal Spaces, Lemmas \ref{formal-spaces-lemma-formal-completion-types} and
\ref{formal-spaces-lemma-map-completions-finite-type}.
Let $Y_j \to Y$ be a jointly surjective family of \'etale morphism
where $Y_j$ is an affine scheme for each $j$.
Denote $T_j \subset Y_j$ the inverse image of $T$.
Then $\{(Y_j)_{/T_j} \to Y_{/T}\}$ is a covering as in
Formal Spaces, Definition \ref{formal-spaces-definition-formal-algebraic-space}.
Moreover, setting $X_j = Y_j \times_Y X$ and $T'_j \subset |X_j|$
the inverse image of $T$, we have
$$
(X_j)_{/T'_j} = (Y_j)_{/T_j} \times_{(Y_{/T})} X_{/T'}
$$
By Lemma \ref{lemma-upshot} we reduce to the case where
$Y$ is an affine Noetherian scheme treated in the next paragraph.

\medskip\noindent
Assume $Y = \Spec(A)$ where $A$ is a Noetherian ring. This implies that
$Y_{/T} = \text{Spf}(A^\wedge)$ where $A^\wedge$ is the $I$-adic completion
of $A$ for some ideal $I \subset A$. Let
$p : \text{Spf}(R) \to \text{Spf}(A^\wedge)$
be an adic morphism where $R$ is a complete discrete valuation ring.
Let $K$ be the field of fractions of $R$.
Consider the composition $A \to A^\wedge \to R$.
Since $X \to Y$ is surjective, the fibre $X_K = \Spec(K) \times_Y X$
is nonempty. Thus we may choose an affine scheme $U$ and an \'etale
morphism $U \to X$ such that $U_K$ is nonempty.
Let $u \in U_K$ be a closed point (possible as $U_K$ is affine). By
Morphisms, Lemma \ref{morphisms-lemma-closed-point-fibre-locally-finite-type}
the residue field $L = \kappa(u)$ is a finite extension of $K$. Let
$R' \subset L$ be the integral closure of $R$ in $L$. By
More on Algebra, Remark \ref{more-algebra-remark-finite-separable-extension}
we see that $R'$ is a discrete valuation ring.
Because $X \to Y$ is proper we see that the given morphism
$\Spec(L) = u \to U_K \to X_K \to X$ extends to a morphism
$\Spec(R') \to X$ over the given morphism $\Spec(R) \to Y$
(Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-characterize-proper}).
By commutativity of the diagram the induced morphisms
$\Spec(R'/\mathfrak m_{R'}^n) \to X$ are points of $X_{/T'}$
and we find
$$
\text{Spf}((R')^\wedge) = \colim \Spec(R'/\mathfrak m_{R'}^n)
\longrightarrow X_{/T'}
$$
as desired (note that $(R')^\wedge$ is a complete discrete valuation ring
by More on Algebra, Lemma \ref{more-algebra-lemma-completion-dvr};
in fact in the current situation $R' = (R')^\wedge$ but we do not
need this).
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-faithfully-flat-rig-surjective}
Let $A$ be a Noetherian ring complete with respect to an ideal $I$.
Let $B$ be an $I$-adically complete $A$-algebra.
If $A/I^n \to B/I^nB$ is of finite type and flat for all $n$ and
faithfully flat for $n = 1$, then $\text{Spf}(B) \to \text{Spf}(A)$
is rig-surjective.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We will use without further mention that morphisms between formal spectra
are given by continuous maps between the corresponding topological rings, see
Formal Spaces, Lemma \ref{formal-spaces-lemma-morphism-between-formal-spectra}.
Let $\varphi : A \to R$ be a continuous map into a complete discrete
valuation ring $A$. This implies that $\varphi(I) \subset \mathfrak m_R$.
On the other hand, since we only need to produce the lift
$\varphi' : B' \to R'$ in the case that $\varphi$ corresponds to an adic
morphism, we may assume that $\varphi(I) \not = 0$. Thus we may consider
the base change $C = B \widehat{\otimes}_A R$, see
Remark \ref{remark-base-change} for example.
Then $C$ is an $\mathfrak m_R$-adically complete $R$-algebra
such that $C/\mathfrak m_R^n C$ is of finite type and flat over
$R/\mathfrak m_R^n$ and such that $C/\mathfrak m_R C$ is nonzero.
Pick any maximal ideal $\mathfrak m \subset C$ lying over
$\mathfrak m_R$. By flatness (which implies going down) we see that
$\Spec(C_\mathfrak m) \setminus V(\mathfrak m_R C_\mathfrak m)$
is a nonempty open. Hence
We can pick a prime $\mathfrak q \subset \mathfrak m$
such that $\mathfrak q$ defines a closed point of
$\Spec(C_\mathfrak m) \setminus \{\mathfrak m\}$ and such that
$\mathfrak q \not \in V(IC_\mathfrak m)$, see
Properties, Lemma \ref{properties-lemma-complement-closed-point-Jacobson}.
Then $C/\mathfrak q$ is a dimension $1$-local domain and we can find
$C/\mathfrak q \subset R'$ with $R'$ a discrete valuation ring
(Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-exists-dvr}).
By construction $\mathfrak m_R R' \subset \mathfrak m_{R'}$
and we see that $C \to R'$ extends to a continuous map
$C \to (R')^\wedge$ (in fact we can pick $R'$ such that
$R' = (R')^\wedge$ in our current situation but we do not need this).
Since the completion of a discrete valuation ring is a discrete
valuation ring, we see that the assumption gives a commutative
diagram of rings
$$
\xymatrix{
(R')^\wedge & C \ar[l] & B \ar[l] \\
R \ar[u] & R \ar[l] \ar[u] & A \ar[l] \ar[u]
}
$$
which gives the desired lift.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-flat-rig-surjective}
Let $A$ be a Noetherian ring complete with respect to an ideal $I$.
Let $B$ be an $I$-adically complete $A$-algebra. Assume that
\begin{enumerate}
\item the $I$-torsion in $A$ is $0$,
\item $A/I^n \to B/I^nB$ is flat and of finite type for all $n$.
\end{enumerate}
Then $\text{Spf}(B) \to \text{Spf}(A)$ is rig-surjective if and only
if $A/I \to B/IB$ is faithfully flat.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Faithful flatness implies rig-surjectivity by
Lemma \ref{lemma-faithfully-flat-rig-surjective}.
To prove the converse we will use without further mention that the
vanishing of $I$-torsion is equivalent to the vanishing of $I$-power torsion
(More on Algebra, Lemma \ref{more-algebra-lemma-torsion-free}).
We will also use without further mention that morphisms between
formal spectra are given by continuous maps between the corresponding
topological rings, see
Formal Spaces, Lemma \ref{formal-spaces-lemma-morphism-between-formal-spectra}.

\medskip\noindent
Assume $\text{Spf}(B) \to \text{Spf}(A)$ is rig-surjective.
Choose a maximal ideal $I \subset \mathfrak m \subset A$.
The open $U = \Spec(A_\mathfrak m) \setminus V(I_\mathfrak m)$
of $\Spec(A_\mathfrak m)$ is nonempty as the $I_\mathfrak m$-torsion of
$A_\mathfrak m$ is zero
(use Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-Noetherian-power-ideal-kills-module}).
Thus we can find a prime $\mathfrak q \subset A_\mathfrak m$ which defines
a point of $U$ (i.e., $IA_\mathfrak m \not \subset \mathfrak q$)
and which corresponds to a closed point
of $\Spec(A_\mathfrak m) \setminus \{\mathfrak m\}$, see
Properties, Lemma \ref{properties-lemma-complement-closed-point-Jacobson}.
Then $A_\mathfrak m/\mathfrak q$ is a dimension $1$ local domain.
Thus we can find an injective local homomorphism of local rings
$A_\mathfrak m/\mathfrak q \subset R$ where $R$ is a discrete valuation ring
(Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-exists-dvr}).
By construction $IR \subset \mathfrak m_R$ and we see that
$A \to R$ extends to a continuous map $A \to R^\wedge$.
Since the completion of a discrete valuation ring is a discrete
valuation ring, we see that the assumption gives a commutative
diagram of rings
$$
\xymatrix{
R' & B \ar[l] \\
R^\wedge \ar[u] & A \ar[l] \ar[u]
}
$$
Thus we find a prime ideal of $B$ lying over $\mathfrak m$. It follows
that $\Spec(B/IB) \to \Spec(A/I)$ is surjective, whence $A/I \to B/IB$
is faithfully flat
(Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-ff-rings}).
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-monomorphism-rig-surjective}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of formal algebraic
spaces. Assume $X$ and $Y$ are locally Noetherian, $f$ locally of finite
type, and $f$ a monomorphism. Then $f$ is rig surjective if and only if
every adic morphism $\text{Spf}(R) \to Y$ where $R$ is a complete discrete
valuation ring factors through $X$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
One direction is trivial. For the other, suppose that $\text{Spf}(R) \to Y$
is an adic morphism such that there exists an extension of complete
discrete valuation rings $R \subset R'$ with
$\text{Spf}(R') \to \text{Spf}(R) \to X$ factoring through $Y$. Then
$\Spec(R'/\mathfrak m_R^n R') \to \Spec(R/\mathfrak m_R^n)$ is surjective
and flat, hence the morphisms $\Spec(R/\mathfrak m_R^n) \to X$ factor
through $X$ as $X$ satisfies the sheaf condition for fpqc coverings, see
Formal Spaces, Lemma \ref{formal-spaces-lemma-sheaf-fpqc}.
In other words, $\text{Spf}(R) \to Y$ factors through $X$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-closed-immersion-rig-surjective}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of formal algebraic
spaces. Assume that $X$ and $Y$ are locally Noetherian and $f$ is a
closed immersion. The following are equivalent
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ is rig-surjective, and
\item for every affine formal algebraic space $V$ and every morphism
$V \to Y$ which is representable by algebraic spaces and \'etale
the morphism $X \times_Y V \to V$ corresponds to a surjective morphism
$B \to A$ in $\textit{WAdm}^{Noeth}$ whose kernel $J$ has the following
property: $IJ^n = 0$ for some ideal of definition $I$ of $B$
and some $n \geq 1$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let us observe that given $V$ and $V \to Y$ as in (2) without any
further assumption on $f$ we see that the morphism $X \times_Y V \to V$
corresponds to a surjective morphism $B \to A$ in $\textit{WAdm}^{Noeth}$
by Formal Algebraic Spaces, Lemma
\ref{formal-spaces-lemma-closed-immersion-into-countably-indexed}.

\medskip\noindent
Assume (1). By Lemma \ref{lemma-base-change-rig-surjective} we see that
$\text{Spf}(A) \to \text{Spf}(B)$ is rig-surjective.
Let $I \subset B$ be an ideal of definition. Since $B$ is adic,
$I^m \subset B$ is an ideal of definition for all $m \geq 1$.
If $I^m J^n \not = 0$ for all $n, m \geq 1$, then
$IJ$ is not nilpotent, hence $V(IJ) \not = \Spec(B)$.
Thus we can find a prime ideal $\mathfrak p \subset B$
with $\mathfrak p \not \in V(I) \cup V(J)$.
Observe that $I(B/\mathfrak p) \not = B/\mathfrak p$
hence we can find a maximal ideal
$\mathfrak p + I \subset \mathfrak m \subset B$.
By Algebra, Lemma \ref{algebra-lemma-exists-dvr}
we can find a discrete valuation ring $R$
and an injective local ring homomorphism $(B/\mathfrak p)_\mathfrak m \to R$.
Clearly, the ring map $B \to R$ cannot factor through $A = B/J$.
According to Lemma \ref{lemma-monomorphism-rig-surjective}
this contradicts the fact that $\text{Spf}(A) \to \text{Spf}(B)$
is rig-surjective. Hence for some $n, m$ we do have
$I^n J^m = 0$ which shows that (2) holds.

\medskip\noindent
Assume (2). By Lemma \ref{lemma-upshot} it suffices to show
that $\text{Spf}(A) \to \text{Spf}(B)$ is rig-surjective.
Pick an ideal of definition $I \subset B$ and an integer $n$
such that $I J^n = 0$.
Consider a ring map $B \to R$ where $R$ is a discrete valuation
ring and the image of $I$ is nonzero. Since $R$ is a domain, we
conclude the image of $J$ in $R$ is zero. Hence $B \to R$
factors through the surjection $B \to A$ and we are done by
definition of rig-surjective morphisms.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-closed-immersion-rig-smooth-rig-surjective}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of formal algebraic
spaces. Assume that $X$ and $Y$ are locally Noetherian and $f$ is a
closed immersion. The following are equivalent
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ is rig-smooth and rig-surjective,
\item $f$ is rig-\'etale and rig-surjective, and
\item for every affine formal algebraic space $V$ and every morphism
$V \to Y$ which is representable by algebraic spaces and \'etale
the morphism $X \times_Y V \to V$ corresponds to a surjective morphism
$B \to A$ in $\textit{WAdm}^{Noeth}$ whose kernel $J$ has the following
property: $IJ = 0$ for some ideal of definition $I$ of $B$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $I$ and $J$ be ideals of a ring $B$ such that $IJ^n = 0$ and
$I(J/J^2) = 0$. Then $I^nJ = 0$ (proof omitted).
Hence this lemma follows from a trivial combination of
Lemmas \ref{lemma-closed-immersion-rig-smooth} and
\ref{lemma-closed-immersion-rig-surjective}.

\section{Formal algebraic spaces over cdvrs}
\label{section-over-cdrv}

\noindent
A few lemmas on formal algebraic spaces over complete discrete valuation rings.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-flat-locus}
Let $R$ be a complete discrete valuation ring. Let
$f : X \to \text{Spf}(R)$ be a morphism of formal algebraic spaces.
There is a canonical closed immersion $X_{flat} \to X$
of formal algebraic spaces such that $X_{flat} \to \text{Spf}(R)$
is flat and such that any morphism $g : Y \to X$ of formal algebraic
spaces with $f \circ g$ flat factors through $X_{flat}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}



\end{proof}








\section{Formal modifications}
\label{section-formal-modifications}

\noindent
In this section we define and study Artin's notion of a formal modification
of locally Noetherian formal algebraic spaces. First, here is the
definition.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-formal-modification}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of
locally Noetherian formal algebraic spaces over $S$. We say $f$ is a
{\it formal modification} if
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ is a proper morphism (Formal Algebraic Spaces, Definition
\ref{formal-spaces-definition-proper}),
\item $f$ is rig-\'etale,
\item $f$ is rig-surjective,
\item $\Delta_f : X \to X \times_Y X$ is rig-surjective.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\noindent
Let us compare these conditions with those in Artin's paper.

\begin{remark}
\label{remark-compare-formal-modification-artin}
In \cite[Definition 1.7]{ArtinII} a formal modification is defined as a
proper morphism $f : X \to Y$ of locally Noetherian formal algebraic spaces
satisfying
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(\romannumeral1)] the Cramer and Jacobian ideal of
$f$ each contain an ideal of definition of $X$,
\item[(\romannumeral2)] the ideal defining the
diagonal map $\Delta : X \to X \times_Y X$
is annihilated by an ideal of definition of $X \times_Y X$, and
\item[(\romannumeral3)] any adic morphism $\text{Spf}(R) \to Y$
lifts to $\text{Spf}(R) \to X$ whenever $R$ is a
complete discrete valuation ring.
\end{enumerate}
Let us compare these to our list of conditions above.

\medskip\noindent
Ad (\romannumeral1). Property (\romannumeral1) agrees with our condition
that $f$ be a rig-\'etale morphism: this follows from
Lemma \ref{lemma-equivalent-with-artin} part (\ref{item-condition-artin}).

\medskip\noindent
Ad (\romannumeral2). Assume $f$ is rig-\'etale. Then
$\Delta_f : X \to X \times_Y X$ is rig-\'etale as a morphism
of locally Noetherian formal algebraic spaces which are
rig-\'etale over $X$ (via $\text{id}_X$ for the first one and via
$\text{pr}_1$ for the second one).
See Lemmas \ref{lemma-base-change-rig-etale} and
\ref{lemma-rig-etale-permanence}.
Hence property (\romannumeral2) agrees with our condition
that $\Delta_f$ be rig-surjective by
Lemma \ref{lemma-closed-immersion-rig-smooth-rig-surjective}.

\medskip\noindent
Ad (\romannumeral1). Property (\romannumeral1) does not quite
agree with our notion of a rig-surjective morphism, as Artin
requires all adic morphisms $\text{Spf}(R) \to Y$ to lift to
morphisms into $X$ whereas our notion of rig-surjective only
asserts the existence of a lift after replacing $R$ by an extension.
FIXME.
\end{remark}









\section{Algebraization}
\label{section-algebraization}

\noindent
In this section we prove a generalization of the result on dilatations
from the paper of Artin \cite{ArtinII}. We first reformulate the algebra
results proved above into the language of formal algebraic spaces.

\medskip\noindent
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $V$ be a locally Noetherian formal algebraic space
over $S$. We denote $\mathcal{C}_V$ the category of formal algebraic
spaces $W$ over $V$ such that the structure morphism $W \to V$ is rig-\'etale.

\medskip\noindent
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $X$ be an algebraic space over $S$.
Let $T \subset |X|$ be a closed subset. Recall that $X_{/T}$ denotes
the formal completion of $X$ along $T$, see 
Formal Spaces, Section \ref{formal-spaces-section-completion}.
More generally, for any algebraic space $Y$ over $X$ we
denote $Y_{/T}$ the completion of $Y$ along the inverse
image of $T$ in $|Y|$, so that $Y_{/T}$ is a formal algebraic space
over $X_{/T}$.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-etale-gives-rig-etale}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $X$ be a locally Noetherian algebraic space over $S$.
Let $T \subset |X|$ be a closed subset. If $Y \to X$ is morphism of
algebraic spaces which is locally of finite type and \'etale over
$X \setminus T$, then $Y_{/T} \to X_{/T}$ is rig-\'etale, i.e., $Y_{/T}$
is an object of $\mathcal{C}_{X_{/T}}$ defined above.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Choose a surjective \'etale morphism $U \to X$ with $U = \coprod U_i$
a disjoint union of affine schemes, see Properties of Spaces, Lemma
\ref{spaces-properties-lemma-cover-by-union-affines}.
For each $i$ choose a surjective \'etale morphism $V_i \to Y \times_X U_i$
where $V_i = \coprod V_{ij}$ is a disjoint union of affines.
Write $U_i = \Spec(A_i)$ and $V_{ij} = \Spec(B_{ij})$.
Let $I_i \subset A_i$ be an ideal cutting out the inverse image
of $T$ in $U_i$. Then we may apply
Lemma \ref{lemma-rig-etale}
to see that the map of $I_i$-adic completions
$A_i^\wedge \to B_{ij}^\wedge$ has the property
$P$ of Lemma \ref{lemma-rig-etale-axioms}.
Since $\{\text{Spf}(A_i^\wedge) \to X_{/T}\}$ and
$\{\text{Spf}(B_{ij}) \to Y_{/T}\}$ are coverings as in
Formal Spaces, Definition
\ref{formal-spaces-definition-formal-algebraic-space}
we see that $Y_{/T} \to X_{/T}$ is rig-\'etale by definition.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-algebraize-morphism-rig-etale}
Let $X$ be a Noetherian affine scheme. Let $T \subset X$ be a closed subset.
Let $U$ be an affine scheme and let $U \to X$ a finite type morphism
\'etale over $X \setminus T$. Let $V$ be a Noetherian affine scheme over $X$.
For any morphism $c' : V_{/T} \to U_{/T}$ over $X_{/T}$ there exists
an \'etale morphism $b : V' \to V$ of affine schemes which induces an
isomorphism $b_{/T} : V'_{/T} \to V_{/T}$ and a morphism $a : V' \to U$
such that $c' = a_{/T} \circ b_{/T}^{-1}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
This is a reformulation of
Lemma \ref{lemma-fully-faithful-etale-over-complement}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-algebraize-rig-etale-affine}
Let $X$ be a Noetherian affine scheme. Let $T \subset X$ be a closed subset.
Let $W \to X_{/T}$ be a rig-\'etale morphism of formal algebraic
spaces with $W$ an affine formal algebraic space. Then there exists
an affine scheme $U$, a finite type morphism $U \to X$ \'etale over
$X \setminus T$ such that $W \cong U_{/T}$.
Moreover, if $W \to X_{/T}$ is \'etale, then $U \to X$ is \'etale.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The existence of $U$ is a restatement of
Lemma \ref{lemma-approximate-by-etale-over-complement}.
The final statement follows from
More on Morphisms, Lemma
\ref{more-morphisms-lemma-check-smoothness-on-infinitesimal-nbhds}.
\end{proof}

\noindent
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $X$ be a locally Noetherian algebraic space over $S$
and let $T \subset |X|$ be a closed subset. Let us denote
$\mathcal{C}_{X, T}$ the category of algebraic spaces $Y$ over $X$
such that the structure morphism $f : Y \to X$
is locally of finite type and an isomorphism over the complement of
$T$. Formal completion defines a functor
\begin{equation}
\label{equation-completion-functor}
F_{X, T} : \mathcal{C}_{X, T} \longrightarrow \mathcal{C}_{X_{/T}},\quad
(f : Y \to X) \longmapsto (f_{/T} : Y_{/T} \to X_{/T})
\end{equation}
see Lemma \ref{lemma-etale-gives-rig-etale}.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-factor}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $f : X \to Y$ and $g : Z \to Y$ be morphisms
of algebraic spaces. Let $T \subset |X|$ be closed.
Assume that
\begin{enumerate}
\item $X$ is locally Noetherian,
\item $g$ is a monomorphism and locally of finite type,
\item $f|_{X \setminus T} : X \setminus T \to Y$ factors through $g$, and
\item $f_{/T} : X_{/T} \to Y$ factors through $g$,
\end{enumerate}
then $f$ factors through $g$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Consider the fibre product $E = X \times_Y Z \to X$.
By assumption the open immersion $X \setminus T \to X$
factors through $E$ and any morphism $\varphi : X' \to X$ with
$|\varphi|(|X'|) \subset T$ factors through $E$ as well, see
Formal Spaces, Section \ref{formal-spaces-section-completion}.
By More on Morphisms of Spaces, Lemma
\ref{spaces-more-morphisms-lemma-check-smoothness-on-infinitesimal-nbhds}
this implies that $E \to X$ is \'etale at every point of $E$
mapping to a point of $T$. Hence $E \to X$ is an \'etale
monomorphism, hence an open immersion
(Morphisms of Spaces, Lemma
\ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-etale-universally-injective-open}).
Then it follows that $E = X$ since our assumptions imply that $|X| = |E|$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-faithful}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $X$, $Y$ be locally Noetherian algebraic spaces
over $S$. Let $T \subset |X|$ and $T' \subset |Y|$ be closed subsets.
Let $a, b : X \to Y$ be morphisms of algebraic spaces over $S$ such
that $a|_{X \setminus T} = b|_{X \setminus T}$, such that
$|a|(T) \subset T'$ and $|b|(T) \subset T'$, and such that
$a_{/T} = b_{/T}$ as morphisms $X_{/T} \to Y_{/T'}$.
Then $a = b$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $E$ be the equalizer of $a$ and $b$. Then $E$ is an algebraic space
and $E \to X$ is locally of finite type and a monomorphism, see
Morphisms of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-properties-diagonal}.
Our assumptions imply we can apply Lemma \ref{lemma-factor} to the two
morphisms $f = \text{id} : X \to X$ and $g : E \to X$ and the closed
subset $T$ of $|X|$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-equivalence-relation}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $X$ be a locally Noetherian algebraic space
over $S$. Let $T \subset |X|$ be a closed subset.
Let $s, t : R \to U$ be two morphisms of algebraic spaces over $X$.
Assume
\begin{enumerate}
\item $R$, $U$ are locally of finite type over $X$,
\item the base change of $s$ and $t$ to $X \setminus T$
is an \'etale equivalence relation, and
\item the formal completion
$(t_{/T}, s_{/T}) : R_{/T} \to U_{/T} \times_{X_{/T}} U_{/T}$
is an equivalence relation too.
\end{enumerate}
Then $(t, s) : R \to U \times_X U$ is an \'etale equivalence relation.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The morphisms $s, t : R \to U$ are \'etale over $X \setminus T$
by assumption. Since the formal completions of the maps
$s, t : R \to U$ are \'etale, we see that $s$ and $t$ are \'etale
for example by More on Morphisms, Lemma
\ref{more-morphisms-lemma-check-smoothness-on-infinitesimal-nbhds}.
Applying Lemma \ref{lemma-factor} to the morphisms
$\text{id} : R \times_{U \times_X U} R \to R \times_{U \times_X U} R$
and $\Delta : R \to R \times_{U \times_X U} R$ we conclude that
$(t, s)$ is a monomorphism. Applying it again to
$(t \circ \text{pr}_0, s \circ \text{pr}_1) :
R \times_{s, U, t} R \to U \times_X U$ and $(t, s) : R \to U \times_X U$
we find that ``transitivity'' holds. We omit the proof of
the other two axioms of an equivalence relation.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
\label{remark-smash-away-from-T}
Let $S$, $X$, and $T \subset |X|$ be as in (\ref{equation-completion-functor}).
Let $U \to X$ be an algebraic space over $X$ such that $U \to X$ is
locally of finite type and \'etale outside of $T$. We will construct a
factorization
$$
U \longrightarrow Y \longrightarrow X
$$
with $Y$ in $\mathcal{C}_{X, T}$ such that $U_{/T} \to Y_{/T}$ is an
isomorphism. We may assume the image of $U \to X$ contains
$X \setminus T$, otherwise we replace $U$ by $U \amalg (X \setminus T)$.
For an algebraic space $Z$ over $X$, let us denote $Z^\circ$
the open subspace which is the inverse image of $X \setminus T$.
Let
$$
R = U \amalg_{U^\circ} (U \times_X U)^\circ
$$
be the pushout of $U^\circ \to U$ and the diagonal morphism
$U^\circ \to U^\circ \times_X U^\circ = (U \times_X U)^\circ$.
Since $U^\circ \to X$ is \'etale, the diagonal is an open immersion
and we see that $R$ is an algebraic space (this follows for example
from Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-lemma-glueing-algebraic-spaces}).
The two projections $(U \times_X U)^\circ \to U$ extend to $R$
and we obtain two \'etale morphisms $s, t : R \to U$. Checking on each
piece separatedly we find that $R$ is an \'etale equivalence
relation on $U$. Set $Y = U/R$ which is an algebraic space by
Bootstrap, Theorem \ref{bootstrap-theorem-final-bootstrap}.
Since $U^\circ \to X \setminus T$ is a surjective \'etale morphism
and since $R^\circ = U^\circ \times_{X \setminus T} U^\circ$
we see that $Y^\circ \to X \setminus T$ is an isomorphism.
In other words, $Y \to X$ is an object of $\mathcal{C}_{X, T}$.
On the other hand, the morphism $U \to Y$ induces an isomorphism
$U_{/T} \to Y_{/T}$. Namely, the formal completion of $R$
along the inverse image of $T$ is equal to the formal completion of
$U$ along the inverse image of $T$ by our choice of $R$. By
our construction of the formal completion in
Formal Spaces, Section \ref{formal-spaces-section-completion}
we conclude that $U_{/T} = Y_{/T}$.
\end{remark}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-dilatations-affine}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $X$ be a Noetherian affine algebraic space over $S$.
Let $T \subset |X|$ be a closed subset. Then the functor $F_{X, T}$ is an
equivalence.
\end{lemma}

\noindent
Before we prove this lemma let us discuss an example. Suppose that
$S = \Spec(k)$, $X = \mathbf{A}^1_k$, and $T = \{0\}$. Then
$X_{/T} = \text{Spf}(k[[x]])$. Let $W = \text{Spf}(k[[x]] \times k[[x]])$.
Then the corresponding $Y$ is the affine line with zero doubled
(Schemes, Example \ref{schemes-example-affine-space-zero-doubled}).
Moreover, this is the output of the construction in
Remark \ref{remark-smash-away-from-T}
starting with $U = X \amalg X$.

\begin{proof}
For any scheme or algebraic space $Z$ over $X$, let us denote
$Z_0 \subset Z$ the inverse image of $T$ with the induced reduced
closed subscheme or subspace structure. Note that $Z_0 = (Z_{/T})_{red}$
is the reduction of the formal completion.

\medskip\noindent
The functor $F_{X, T}$ is faithful by Lemma \ref{lemma-faithful}.

\medskip\noindent
Let $Y, Y'$ be objects of $\mathcal{C}_{X, T}$ and let
$a' : Y_{/T} \to Y'_{/T}$ be a morphism in $\mathcal{C}_{X_{/T}}$.
To prove $F_{X, T}$ is fully faithful, we will construct a morphism
$a : Y \to Y'$ in $\mathcal{C}_{X, T}$ such that $a' = a_{/T}$.

\medskip\noindent
Let $U$ be an affine scheme and let $U \to Y$ be an \'etale morphism.
Because $U$ is affine, $U_0$ is affine and the image of
$U_0 \to Y_0 \to Y'_0$ is a quasi-compact subspace of $|Y'_0|$.
Thus we can choose an affine scheme $V$ and an \'etale morphism
$V \to Y'$ such that the image of $|V_0| \to |Y'_0|$
contains this quasi-compact subset. Consider the formal algebraic space
$$
W = U_{/T} \times_{Y'_{/T}} V_{/T}
$$
By our choice of $V$ the above, the map $W \to U_{/T}$ is surjective.
Thus there exists an affine formal algebraic space $W'$ and an \'etale
morphism $W' \to W$ such that $W' \to W \to U_{/T}$ is surjective.
Then $W' \to U_{/T}$ is \'etale.
By Lemma \ref{lemma-algebraize-rig-etale-affine} $W' = U'_{/T}$
for $U' \to U$ \'etale and $U'$ affine. Write $V = \Spec(C)$. By
Lemma \ref{lemma-algebraize-morphism-rig-etale} there exists an
\'etale morphism $U'' \to U'$ of affines which is an isomorphism on
completions and a morphism $U'' \to V$ whose completion is
the composition $U''_{/T} \to U'_{/T} \to W \to V_{/T}$.
Thus we get
$$
Y \longleftarrow U'' \longrightarrow Y'
$$
over $X$ agreeing with the given map on formal completions such that
the image of $U''_0 \to Y_0$ is the same as the image of $U_0 \to Y_0$.

\medskip\noindent
Taking a disjoint union of $U''$ as constructed in the previous
paragraph, we find a scheme $U$, an \'etale morphism $U \to Y$,
and a morphism $b : U \to Y'$ over $X$, such that the diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
U_{/T} \ar[d] \ar[rd]^{b_{/T}} \\
Y_{/T} \ar[r]^{a'} & Y'_{/T}
}
$$
is commutative and such that $U_0 \to Y_0$ is surjective.
Taking a disjoint union with the open $X \setminus T$ (which is also
open in $Y$ and $Y'$), we find that we may even assume that $U \to Y$
is a surjective \'etale morphism. Let $R = U \times_Y U$.
Then the two compositions $R \to U \to Y'$ agree both over $X \setminus T$
and after formal completion along $T$, whence are equal by
Lemma \ref{lemma-faithful}. This means exactly that $b$ factors as
$U \to Y \to Y'$ to give us our desired morphism $a : Y \to Y'$.

\medskip\noindent
Essential surjectivity. Let $W$ be an object of $\mathcal{C}_{X_{/T}}$.
We prove $W$ is in the essential image in a number of steps.

\medskip\noindent
Step 1: $W$ is an affine formal algebraic space. Then we can find
$U \to X$ of finite type and \'etale over $X \setminus T$ such that
$U_{/T}$ is isomorphic to $W$, see
Lemma \ref{lemma-algebraize-rig-etale-affine}.
Thus we see that $W$ is in the essential image by the construction
in Remark \ref{remark-smash-away-from-T}.

\medskip\noindent
Step 2: $W$ is separated. Choose $\{W_i \to W\}$ as in
Formal Spaces, Definition \ref{formal-spaces-definition-formal-algebraic-space}.
By Step 1 the formal algebraic spaces $W_i$ and $W_i \times_W W_j$
are in the essential image.
Say $W_i = (Y_i)_{/T}$ and $W_i \times_W W_j = (Y_{ij})_{/T}$.
By fully faithfulness we obtain morphisms $t_{ij} : Y_{ij} \to Y_i$
and $s_{ij} : Y_{ij} \to Y_j$ matching the projections
$W_i \times_W W_j \to W_i$ and $W_i \times_W W_j \to W_j$.
Set $R = \coprod Y_{ij}$ and $U = \coprod Y_i$ and denote
$s = \coprod s_{ij} : R \to U$ and $t = \coprod t_{ij} : R \to U$.
Applying Lemma \ref{lemma-equivalence-relation}
we find that $(t, s) : R \to U \times_X U$ is an \'etale equivalence relation.
Thus we can take the quotient $Y = U/R$ and it is an algebraic
space, see 
Bootstrap, Theorem \ref{bootstrap-theorem-final-bootstrap}.
Since completion commutes with fibre products and taking
quotient sheaves, we find that $Y_{/T} \cong W$ in $\mathcal{C}_{X_{/T}}$.

\medskip\noindent
Step 3: $W$ is general. Choose $\{W_i \to W\}$ as in
Formal Spaces, Definition \ref{formal-spaces-definition-formal-algebraic-space}.
The formal algebraic spaces $W_i$ and $W_i \times_W W_j$ are separated.
Hence by Step 2  the formal algebraic spaces $W_i$ and $W_i \times_W W_j$
are in the essential image. Then we argue exactly as in the previous
paragraph to see that $W$ is in the essential image as well.
This concludes the proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
\label{theorem-dilatations-general}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $X$ be a locally Noetherian algebraic space over $S$.
Let $T \subset |X|$ be a closed subset. The functor $F_{X, T}$
(\ref{equation-completion-functor})
$$
\left\{
\begin{matrix}
\text{algebraic spaces }Y\text{ locally of finite}\\
\text{type over }X\text{ such that }Y \to X\\
\text{is an isomorphism over }X \setminus T
\end{matrix}
\right\}
\longrightarrow
\left\{
\begin{matrix}
\text{formal algebraic spaces }W\text{ endowed} \\
\text{with a rig-\'etale morphism }W \to X_{/T}
\end{matrix}
\right\}
$$
given by formal completion is an equivalence.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The theorem is essentially a formal consequence of
Lemma \ref{lemma-dilatations-affine}. We give the details but
we encourage the reader to think it through for themselves.
Let $g : U \to X$ be a surjective \'etale morphism with $U = \coprod U_i$
and each $U_i$ affine. Denote $F_{U, T}$ the functor for $U$ and the
inverse image of $T$ in $|U|$.

\medskip\noindent
Since $U = \coprod U_i$ both the category $\mathcal{C}_{U, T}$ and
the category $\mathcal{C}_{U_{/T}}$ decompose as a product of categories,
one for each $i$. Since the functors $F_{U_i, T}$ are equivalences
for all $i$ by the lemma we find that the same is true for $F_{U, T}$.

\medskip\noindent
Since $F_{U, T}$ is faithful, it follows that $F_{X, T}$
is faithful too. Namely, if $a, b : Y \to Y'$ are morphisms
in $\mathcal{C}_{X, T}$ such that $a_{/T} = b_{/T}$, then we find
on pulling back that the base changes
$a_U, b_U : U \times_X Y \to U \times_X Y'$ are equal.
Since $U \times_X Y \to Y$ is surjective \'etale, this implies that $a = b$.

\medskip\noindent
At this point we know that $F_{X, T}$ is faithful for every situation
as in the theorem. Let $R = U \times_X U$ where $U$ is as above.
Let $t, s : R \to U$ be the projections.
Since $X$ is Noetherian, so is $R$. Thus the functor $F_{R, T}$
(defined in the obvious manner) is
faithful. Let $Y \to X$ and $Y' \to X$ be objects of $\mathcal{C}_{X, T}$.
Let $a' : Y_{/T} \to Y'_{/T}$ be a morphism in the category
$\mathcal{C}_{X_{/T}}$. Taking the base change to $U$ we obtain a
morphism $a'_U : (U \times_X Y)_{/T} \to (U \times_X Y')_{/T}$
in the category $\mathcal{C}_{U_{/T}}$. Since the functor $F_{U, T}$
is fully faithful we obtain a morphism $a_U : U \times_X Y \to U \times_X Y'$
with $F_{U, T}(a_U) = a'_U$. Since $s^*(a'_U) = t^*(a'_U)$ and since
$F_{R, T}$ is faithful, we find that $s^*(a_U) = t^*(a_U)$.
Since
$$
\xymatrix{
R \times_X Y \ar@<1ex>[r] \ar@<-1ex>[r] &
U \times_X Y \ar[r] & Y
}
$$
is an equalizer diagram of sheaves, we find that $a_U$ descends to
a morphism $a : Y \to Y'$. We omit the proof that $F_{X, T}(a) = a'$.

\medskip\noindent
At this point we know that $F_{X, T}$ is faithful for every situation
as in the theorem. To finish the proof we show that $F_{X, T}$ is
essentially surjective. Let $W \to X_{/T}$ be an object of
$\mathcal{C}_{X_{/T}}$. Then $U \times_X W$ is an object of
$\mathcal{C}_{U_{/T}}$. By the affine case we find an object
$V \to U$ of $\mathcal{C}_{U, T}$ and an isomorphism
$\alpha : F_{U, T}(V) \to U \times_X W$ in $\mathcal{C}_{U_{/T}}$.
By fully faithfulness of $F_{R, T}$ we find a unique morphism
$h : s^*V \to t^*V$ in the category $\mathcal{C}_{R, T}$ such that
$F_{R, T}(h)$ corresponds, via the isomorphism $\alpha$, to the
canonical descent datum on $U \times_X W$ in the category
$\mathcal{C}_{R_{/T}}$. Using faithfulness of our functor on
$R \times_{s, U, t} R$ we see that $h$ satisfies the cocycle
condition. We conclude, for example by the much more general
Bootstrap, Lemma \ref{bootstrap-lemma-descend-algebraic-space},
that there exists an object $Y \to X$ of $\mathcal{C}_{X, T}$
and an isomorphism $\beta : U \times_X Y \to V$ such that the
descent datum $h$ corresponds, via $\beta$, to the canonical descent
datum on $U \times_X Y$. We omit the verification that
$F_{X, T}(Y)$ is isomorphic to $W$; hint: in the category of formal
algebraic spaces there is descent for morphisms along \'etale coverings.
\end{proof}

\noindent
We are often interested as to whether the output of the construction
of Theorem \ref{theorem-dilatations-general} is a separated algebraic space.
In the next few lemmas we match properties of $Y \to X$ and the corresponding
completion $Y_{/T} \to X_{/T}$.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-output-quasi-compact}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $X$ be a locally Noetherian algebraic space over $S$.
Let $T \subset |X|$ be a closed subset. Let $W \to X_{/T}$ be an object
of the category $\mathcal{C}_{X_{/T}}$ and let $Y \to X$ be the object
corresponding to $W$ via Theorem \ref{theorem-dilatations-general}.
Then $Y \to X$ is quasi-compact if and only if $W \to X_{/T}$ is so.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
These conditions may be checked after base change to an affine
scheme \'etale over $X$, resp.\ a formal affine algebraic space
\'etale over $X_{/T}$, see
Morphisms of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-quasi-compact-local}
as well as Formal Spaces, Lemma
\ref{formal-spaces-lemma-characterize-quasi-compact-morphism}.
If $U \to X$ ranges over \'etale morphisms with $U$ affine, then
the formal completions $U_{/T} \to X_{/T}$ give a family
of formal affine coverings as in Formal Spaces, Definition
\ref{formal-spaces-definition-formal-algebraic-space}.
Thus we may and do assume $X$ is affine.

\medskip\noindent
Let $V \to Y$ be a surjective \'etale morphism
where $V = \coprod_{j \in J} V_j$ is a disjoint union of affines. Then
$V_{/T} \to Y_{/T} = W$ is a surjective \'etale morphism.
Thus if $Y$ is quasi-compact, we can choose $J$ is finite, and
we conclude that $W$ is quasi-compact. Conversely, if $W$ is
quasi-compact, then we can find a finite subset $J' \subset J$
such that $\coprod_{j \in J'} (V_j)_{/T} \to W$ is surjective.
Then it follows that
$$
(X \setminus T) \amalg \coprod\nolimits_{j \in J'} V_j \longrightarrow Y
$$
is surjective. This either follows from the construction of
$Y$ in the proof of Lemma \ref{lemma-dilatations-affine}
or it follows since we have
$$
|Y| = |X \setminus T| \amalg |W_{red}|
$$
as $Y_{/T} = W$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-output-quasi-separated}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $X$ be a locally Noetherian algebraic space over $S$.
Let $T \subset |X|$ be a closed subset. Let $W \to X_{/T}$ be an object
of the category $\mathcal{C}_{X_{/T}}$ and let $Y \to X$ be the object
corresponding to $W$ via Theorem \ref{theorem-dilatations-general}.
Then $Y \to X$ is quasi-separated if and only if $W \to X_{/T}$ is so.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
These conditions may be checked after base change to an affine
scheme \'etale over $X$, resp.\ a formal affine algebraic space
\'etale over $X_{/T}$, see
Morphisms of Spaces, Lemma
\ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-separated-local}
as well as
Formal Spaces, Lemma
\ref{formal-spaces-lemma-separated-local},
If $U \to X$ ranges over \'etale morphisms with $U$ affine, then
the formal completions $U_{/T} \to X_{/T}$ give a family
of formal affine coverings as in Formal Spaces, Definition
\ref{formal-spaces-definition-formal-algebraic-space}.
Thus we may and do assume $X$ is affine.

\medskip\noindent
Let $V \to Y$ be a surjective \'etale morphism
where $V = \coprod_{j \in J} V_j$ is a disjoint union of affines.
Then $Y$ is quasi-separated if and only if $V_j \times_Y V_{j'}$ is
quasi-compact for all $j, j' \in J$. Similarly, $W$ is quasi-separated
if and only if
$(V_j \times_Y V_{j'})_{/T} = (V_j)_{/T} \times_{Y_{/T}} (V_{j'})_{/T}$
is quasi-compact for all $j, j' \in J$. Since $X$ is Noetherian affine,
we see that
$$
(V_j \times_Y V_{j'}) \times_X (X \setminus T)
$$
is quasi-compact. Hence we conclude the equivalence holds by the equality
$$
|V_j \times_Y V_{j'}| =
|(V_j \times_Y V_{j'}) \times_X (X \setminus T)| \amalg
|(V_j \times_Y V_{j'})_{/T}|
$$
and the fact that the second summand is closed in the left hand side.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-output-separated}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $X$ be a locally Noetherian algebraic space over $S$.
Let $T \subset |X|$ be a closed subset. Let $W \to X_{/T}$ be an object
of the category $\mathcal{C}_{X_{/T}}$ and let $Y \to X$ be the object
corresponding to $W$ via Theorem \ref{theorem-dilatations-general}.
Then $Y \to X$ is separated if and only if $W \to X_{/T}$ is
separated and $\Delta : W \to W \times_{X_{/T}} W$ is rig-surjective.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
These conditions may be checked after base change to an affine
scheme \'etale over $X$, resp.\ a formal affine algebraic space
\'etale over $X_{/T}$, see
Morphisms of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-separated-local}
as well as
Formal Spaces, Lemma \ref{formal-spaces-lemma-separated-local}.
If $U \to X$ ranges over \'etale morphisms with $U$ affine, then
the formal completions $U_{/T} \to X_{/T}$ give a family
of formal affine coverings as in Formal Spaces, Definition
\ref{formal-spaces-definition-formal-algebraic-space}.
Thus we may and do assume $X$ is affine.
In the proof of both directions we may assume that $Y \to X$ and
$W \to X_{/T}$ are quasi-separated by
Lemma \ref{lemma-output-quasi-separated}.

\medskip\noindent
Proof of easy direction. Assume $Y \to X$ is separated.
Then $Y \to Y \times_X Y$ is a closed immersion and it follows that
$W \to W \times_{X_{/T}} W$ is a closed immersion too, i.e., we see
that $W \to X_{/T}$ is separated. Let
$$
p : \text{Spf}(R) \longrightarrow W \times_{X_{/T}} W = (Y \times_X Y)_{/T}
$$
be an adic morphism where $R$ is a complete discrete valuation ring with
fraction field $K$. The composition into $Y \times_X Y$ corresponds to
a morphism $g : \Spec(R) \to Y \times_X Y$, see
Formal Spaces, Lemma \ref{formal-spaces-lemma-map-into-algebraic-space}.
Since $p$ is an adic morphism, so is the composition $\text{Spf}(R) \to X$.
Thus we see that $g(\Spec(K))$ is a point of
$$
(Y \times_X Y) \times_X (X \setminus T) \cong
X \setminus T \cong
Y \times_X (X \setminus T)
$$
(small detail omitted). Hence this lifts to a $K$-point of $Y$ and
we obtain a commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
\Spec(K) \ar[r] \ar[d] & Y \ar[d] \\
\Spec(R) \ar[r] \ar@{-->}[ru] & Y \times_X Y
}
$$
Since $Y \to X$ was assumed separated we find the dotted arrow exists
(Cohomology of Spaces, Lemma
\ref{spaces-cohomology-lemma-check-separated-dvr}).
Applying the functor completion along $T$ we find that $p$ can be
lifted to a morphism into $W$, i.e., $W \to W \times_{X_{/T}} W$ is
rig-surjective.

\medskip\noindent
Proof of hard direction. Assume $W \to X_{/T}$ separated and
$W \to W \times_{X_{/T}} W$ rig-surjective. By
Cohomology of Spaces, Lemma
\ref{spaces-cohomology-lemma-check-separated-dvr} and
Remark \ref{spaces-cohomology-remark-variant}
it suffices to show that given any commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
\Spec(K) \ar[r] \ar[d] & Y \ar[d] \\
\Spec(R) \ar[r]^g \ar@{-->}[ru] & Y \times_X Y
}
$$
where $R$ is a complete discrete valuation ring with fraction field $K$,
there is at most one dotted arrow making the diagram commute. Let
$h : \Spec(R) \to X$ be the composition of $g$ with the morphism
$Y \times_X Y \to X$. There are three cases:
Case I: $h(\Spec(R)) \subset (X \setminus T)$. This case is trivial
because $Y \times_X (X \setminus T) = X \setminus T$.
Case II: $h$ maps $\Spec(R)$ into $T$. This case follows
from our assumption that $W \to X_{/T}$ is separated. Namely,
if $T$ denotes the reduced induced closed subspace structure
on $T$, then $h$ factors through $T$ and
$$
W \times_{X_{/T}} T = Y \times_X T \longrightarrow T
$$
is separated by assumption (and for example
Formal Spaces, Lemma \ref{formal-spaces-lemma-separated-local})
which implies we get the lifting property by
Cohomology of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-cohomology-lemma-check-separated-dvr}
applied to the displayed arrow. Case III: $h(\Spec(K))$ is not in $T$
but $h$ maps the closed point of $\Spec(R)$ into $T$. In this case
the corresponding morphism
$$
g_{/T} :
\text{Spf}(R)
\longrightarrow
(Y \times_X Y)_{/T} =
W \times_{X_{/T}} W
$$
is an adic morphism (detail omitted). Hence our assumption that
$W \to W \times_{X_{/T}} W$ be rig-surjective implies we can lift
$g_{/T}$ to a morphism $e : \text{Spf}(R) \to W = Y_{/T}$ (see
Lemma \ref{lemma-monomorphism-rig-surjective}
for why we do not need to extend $R$).
Algebraizing the composition $\text{Spf}(R) \to Y$ using
Formal Spaces, Lemma \ref{formal-spaces-lemma-map-into-algebraic-space}
we find a morphism $\Spec(R) \to Y$ lifting $g$ as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-output-proper}
Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $X$ be a locally Noetherian algebraic space over $S$.
Let $T \subset |X|$ be a closed subset. Let $W \to X_{/T}$ be an object
of the category $\mathcal{C}_{X_{/T}}$ and let $Y \to X$ be the object
corresponding to $W$ via Theorem \ref{theorem-dilatations-general}.
Then $Y \to X$ is proper if and only if the following conditions hold
\begin{enumerate}
\item $W \to X_{/T}$ is proper,
\item $W \to X_{/T}$ is rig-surjective, and
\item $\Delta : W \to W \times_{X_{/T}} W$ is rig-surjective.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
These conditions may be checked after base change to an affine
scheme \'etale over $X$, resp.\ a formal affine algebraic space
\'etale over $X_{/T}$, see
Morphisms of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-morphisms-lemma-proper-local}
as well as
Formal Spaces, Lemma \ref{formal-spaces-lemma-proper-local}.
If $U \to X$ ranges over \'etale morphisms with $U$ affine, then
the formal completions $U_{/T} \to X_{/T}$ give a family
of formal affine coverings as in Formal Spaces, Definition
\ref{formal-spaces-definition-formal-algebraic-space}.
Thus we may and do assume $X$ is affine.
In the proof of both directions we may assume that $Y \to X$
and $W \to X_{/T}$ are separated and quasi-compact and that
$W \to W \times_{X_{/T}} W$ is rig-surjective by
Lemmas \ref{lemma-output-quasi-compact} and \ref{lemma-output-separated}.

\medskip\noindent
Proof of the easy direction. Assume $Y \to X$ is proper.
Then $Y_{/T} = Y \times_X X_{/T} \to X_{/T}$ is proper too.
Let
$$
p : \text{Spf}(R) \longrightarrow X_{/T}
$$
be an adic morphism where $R$ is a complete discrete valuation ring with
fraction field $K$. Then $p$ corresponds to a morphism $g : \Spec(R) \to X$,
see
Formal Spaces, Lemma \ref{formal-spaces-lemma-map-into-algebraic-space}.
Since $p$ is an adic morphism, we have $p(\Spec(K)) \not \in T$.
Since $Y \to X$ is an isomorphism over $X \setminus T$ we can lift
to $X$ and obtain a commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
\Spec(K) \ar[r] \ar[d] & Y \ar[d] \\
\Spec(R) \ar[r] \ar@{-->}[ru] & X
}
$$
Since $Y \to X$ was assumed proper we find the dotted arrow exists.
(Cohomology of Spaces, Lemma
\ref{spaces-cohomology-lemma-check-proper-dvr}).
Applying the functor completion along $T$ we find that $p$ can be
lifted to a morphism into $W$, i.e., $W \to X_{/T}$ is
rig-surjective.

\medskip\noindent
Proof of hard direction. Assume $W \to X_{/T}$ proper,
$W \to W \times_{X_{/T}} W$ rig-surjective, and $W \to X_{/T}$
rig-surjective. By
Cohomology of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-cohomology-lemma-check-proper-dvr} and
Remark \ref{spaces-cohomology-remark-variant}
it suffices to show that given any commutative diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
\Spec(K) \ar[r] \ar[d] & Y \ar[d] \\
\Spec(R) \ar[r]^g \ar@{-->}[ru] & X
}
$$
where $R$ is a complete discrete valuation ring with fraction field $K$,
there is a dotted arrow making the diagram commute. Let
$h : \Spec(R) \to X$ be the composition of $g$ with the morphism
$Y \times_X Y \to X$. There are three cases:
Case I: $h(\Spec(R)) \subset (X \setminus T)$. This case is trivial
because $Y \times_X (X \setminus T) = X \setminus T$.
Case II: $h$ maps $\Spec(R)$ into $T$. This case follows
from our assumption that $W \to X_{/T}$ is proper. Namely,
if $T$ denotes the reduced induced closed subspace structure
on $T$, then $h$ factors through $T$ and
$$
W \times_{X_{/T}} T = Y \times_X T \longrightarrow T
$$
is proper by assumption which implies we get the lifting property by
Cohomology of Spaces, Lemma \ref{spaces-cohomology-lemma-check-proper-dvr}
applied to the displayed arrow. Case III: $h(\Spec(K))$ is not in $T$
but $h$ maps the closed point of $\Spec(R)$ into $T$. In this case
the corresponding morphism
$$
g_{/T} : \text{Spf}(R) \longrightarrow Y_{/T} = W
$$
is an adic morphism (detail omitted). Hence our assumption that
$W \to X_{/T}$ be rig-surjective implies we can lift
$g_{/T}$ to a morphism $e : \text{Spf}(R') \to W = Y_{/T}$
for some extension of complete discrete valuation rings $R \subset R'$.
Algebraizing the composition $\text{Spf}(R') \to Y$ using
Formal Spaces, Lemma \ref{formal-spaces-lemma-map-into-algebraic-space}
we find a morphism $\Spec(R') \to Y$ lifting $g$. By the discussion
in Cohomology of Spaces, Remark \ref{spaces-cohomology-remark-variant}
this is sufficient to conclude that $Y \to X$ is proper.
\end{proof}





\section{Application to modifications}
\label{section-modifications}

\noindent
Let $A$ be a Noetherian ring and let $I \subset A$ be an ideal. We set
$S = \Spec(A)$ and $U = S \setminus V(I)$. In this section
we will consider the category
\begin{equation}
\label{equation-modification}
\left\{
f : X \longrightarrow S
\quad \middle| \quad
\begin{matrix}
X\text{ is an algebraic space}\\
f\text{ is locally of finite type}\\
f^{-1}(U) \to U\text{ is an isomorphism}
\end{matrix}
\right\}
\end{equation}
A morphism from $X/S$ to $X'/S$ will be a morphism of algebraic spaces
$X \to X'$ compatible with the structure morphisms over $S$.

\medskip\noindent
Let $A \to B$ be a homomorphism of Noetherian rings and let $J \subset B$
be an ideal such that $J = \sqrt{I B}$. Then base
change along the morphism $\Spec(B) \to \Spec(A)$ gives a functor
from the category (\ref{equation-modification}) for $A$
to the category (\ref{equation-modification}) for $B$.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-Noetherian-local-ring}
Let $(A, I)$ be a pair consisting of a Noetherian ring and an ideal $I$.
Let $A^\wedge$ be the $I$-adic completion of $A$. Then base change defines
an equivalence of categories between the category (\ref{equation-modification})
for $A$ with the category (\ref{equation-modification}) for the completion
$A^\wedge$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Set $S = \Spec(A)$ as in (\ref{equation-modification}) and $T = V(I)$.
Similarly, write $S' = \Spec(A^\wedge)$ and $T' = V(IA^\wedge)$.
The morphism $S' \to S$ defines an isomorphism $S'_{/T'} \to S_{/T}$
of formal completions. Let $\mathcal{C}_{S, T}$, $\mathcal{C}_{S_{/T}}$,
$\mathcal{C}_{S'_{/T'}}$, and $\mathcal{C}_{S', T'}$ be the corresponding
categories as used in (\ref{equation-completion-functor}).
By Theorem \ref{theorem-dilatations-general} (in fact we only need
the affine case treated in Lemma \ref{lemma-dilatations-affine})
we see that
$$
\mathcal{C}_{S, T} = \mathcal{C}_{S_{/T}} =
\mathcal{C}_{S_{/T'}'} = \mathcal{C}_{S', T'}
$$
Since $\mathcal{C}_{S, T}$ is the category (\ref{equation-modification})
for $A$ and $\mathcal{C}_{S', T'}$ the category (\ref{equation-modification})
for $A^\wedge$ this proves the lemma.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-Noetherian-local-ring-properties}
Notation and assumptions as in Lemma \ref{lemma-Noetherian-local-ring}.
Let $f : X \to \Spec(A)$ correspond to $g : Y \to \Spec(A^\wedge)$
via the equivalence. Then $f$ is quasi-compact, quasi-separated, separated,
proper, finite, and add more here if and only if $g$ is so.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
You can deduce this for the statements
quasi-compact, quasi-separated, separated, and proper
by using Lemmas \ref{lemma-output-quasi-compact}
\ref{lemma-output-quasi-separated},
\ref{lemma-output-separated},
\ref{lemma-output-quasi-separated}, and
\ref{lemma-output-proper}
to translate the corresponding property into a property
of the formal completion and using the argument of the proof
of Lemma \ref{lemma-Noetherian-local-ring}.
However, there is a direct argument using fpqc descent as follows.
First, note that $\{U \to \Spec(A), \Spec(A^\wedge) \to \Spec(A)\}$ is an
fpqc covering with $U = \Spec(A) \setminus V(I)$ as before.
The base change of $f$ by $U \to \Spec(A)$ is $\text{id}_U$
by definition of our category (\ref{equation-modification}).
Let $P$ be a property of morphisms of algebraic spaces which
is fpqc local on the base (Descent on Spaces, Definition
\ref{spaces-descent-definition-property-morphisms-local})
such that $P$ holds for identity morphisms.
Then we see that $P$ holds for $f$ if and only if $P$ holds for $g$.
This applies to $P$ equal to
quasi-compact, quasi-separated, separated, proper, and finite
by
Descent on Spaces, Lemmas
\ref{spaces-descent-lemma-descending-property-quasi-compact},
\ref{spaces-descent-lemma-descending-property-quasi-separated},
\ref{spaces-descent-lemma-descending-property-separated},
\ref{spaces-descent-lemma-descending-property-proper}, and
\ref{spaces-descent-lemma-descending-property-finite}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-equivalence-to-completion}
Let $A \to B$ be a local map of local Noetherian rings such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item $A \to B$ is flat,
\item $\mathfrak m_B = \mathfrak m_A B$, and
\item $\kappa(\mathfrak m_A) = \kappa(\mathfrak m_B)$
\end{enumerate}
(equivalently, $A \to B$ induces an isomorphism on completions, see
More on Algebra, Lemma \ref{more-algebra-lemma-flat-unramified}).
Then the base change functor from the category
(\ref{equation-modification}) for $(A, \mathfrak m_A)$ to the category
(\ref{equation-modification}) for $(B, \mathfrak m_B)$
is an equivalence.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
This follows immediately from Lemma \ref{lemma-Noetherian-local-ring}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-dominate-by-admissible-blowup}
Let $(A, \mathfrak m, \kappa)$ be a Noetherian local ring.
Let $f : X \to S$ be an object of (\ref{equation-modification}).
Then there exists a $U$-admissible blowup $S' \to S$
which dominates $X$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Special case of More on Morphisms of Spaces,
Lemma \ref{spaces-more-morphisms-lemma-dominate-modification-by-blowup}.
